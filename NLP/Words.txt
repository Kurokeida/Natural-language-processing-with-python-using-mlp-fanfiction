	Derpy Hooves awoke, as always, to a light, rhythmic flutter against the mattress.  The mare curled up in bed, shifting beneath the covers.  At last, using her wings for leverage, she pushed herself into a sitting position.  With instinctual grace, she opened just her left eye and peered blearily around her apartment bedroom.

A soft golden light pierced the sheer draperies of her bedside window, refracting into platinum bands that glinted off the mirror of her vanity across the humbly furnished room from where she sat.  A dull fuzz lingered in the extreme corners of her abode, melting away with each second that Derpy breathed awake.  She still felt the rhythmic vibrations against the mattress, and so it was with wincing hesitation that she finally opened her right eye.

Derpy's vision fogged, then jittered, puncturing her temple with an all-too-familiar jab of pain.  Soon, though, her eyes locked into solid positions within her skull, and she craned her head left towards the source of the alarm.  An enchanted horizontal lever persistently patted the mare's bed from where it was rigged to the top of a squat, crystal-powered rod.  Stretching her left wing, Derpy rubbed the crystal-laden top of the staff with her gray feathers.  With a dim blue flicker of magic, the tapping lever went dormant, and all was still.

Crawling out of bed, Derpy alighted the floor.  Her tiny hooves reveled in the soft touch of the fuzzy beige upholstery, and she took a moment to stretch her back, neck, shoulders, and—at last—her stiff and unpreened feathers.  Every crackling jolt sent electrical sparks up her spine, until the last trace of a migraine was gone... for now.

With a slight teeter, Derpy turned to her left and trotted towards the window.  Gentle, moist spring air wafted against her muzzle as she spread the curtain wide.  Once again, there was a stab of pain to her swiveling eyes, but it didn't last for long this time.  Derpy found herself smiling as she took in the dewy lengths of a rich morning, with gold dawnlight refracting off the wet green lawn and giving the misty air a bleached aura.  Traces of overnight fog hung lazily, pendulous, waiting to dissipate upon the next warm breath.

Derpy sighed.  She twirled about-face, careful to close one eye so as not to disorient herself.  She made a bee-line for the bathroom where she enjoyed a lusciously warm shower.  The mare took a good ten minutes to lean her exhausted head against the glossy eggshell tile, relishing the soothing stroke of warm droplets rivering down her neck and flank, saturating her coat with delicious warmth and clinging thickly to her blonde mane.

All too soon for her liking, the shower ended, but she busied herself for the next twenty minutes with filing her hooves, drying her mane, and straightening her tail.  Derpy had gotten most of the moisture out of her hair—just enough for the morning flight to do the rest.  She paused before her bedside vanity to observe her mane.  Licking a hoof, she stroked a tuft of blonde bangs and pulled it down to obscure the very edge of a scar that peeked out the right side of her scalp.  She winced slightly, but the pain didn't last long, and she squinted with one eye to admire her hoofwork.

Soon after, Derpy Hooves stepped out into the lively, golden world.  She took flight, watching with a toasty smile as the rustic lengths of Ponyville stretched out all around her, its multitude of yellow-thatched rooftops like little tiny bonfires in the way they caught the luminous glint of the sun's penetrating rise.  Far beyond the houses, a calico array of farmlands and apple groves stretched between the tiny earth pony town and the looming majesty of Canterlot in the far distance.  It wasn't long before Derpy ascended above the clouds, and it was just in time to spot the dawn's amber gaze as it bathed the royal bowers of Equestria's Capital from spire to glimmering spire.

It was here, adrift in the high gusty winds, that Derpy felt the most titillating sensation of all.  Tiny pools of moisture lingered within the fuzz of her ears, and the breeze tickled her inside and out.  She closed her eyes, surrendering to the glide of her outstretched wings, until all the droplets had finally dried.  The dull pain returned, periodic yet throbbing.  She reopened her eyes with only the slightest wince, then began her routine descent into the merchant district of the modest town.

Immediately, Derpy trotted through the entrance to Sugarcube Corner.  The pegasus' eyelids fluttered from the rapid change in air pressure before basking happily in the mauve and fucshia pastels of the aromatic bakery around her.  She passed familiar faces and grinning muzzles: a cornacopia of pretty pony expressions that flickered about in her swirling peripheral.  As she approached the counter, she reveled in the fine scents of cinnamon and gingerbread wafting out of the kitchen and mixing with the fragrant texture of fresh coffee grounds.

The mare tilted her gray head aside, squinting her right eye and allowing her left to peer around the kitchen, searching for a familiar blue coat and an even more familiar mane of salmon-colored hair.  Despite her ardent focus, she noticed a distinct shudder of equine bodies along the very edge of her vision.

With dual blinks, the mare turned to her far left and peered across the eatery.  A pair of young mares immediately pivoted their heads away from her, though Derpy could spot a mischievous grin being shared between the two.  One pony brushed her mane aside, stealing a secret glance at Derpy and smirking harder.  Her head bobbed as her nostrils flared above a smirking expression.

Derpy bit her lip.  When she glanced back at the counter, she jolted, for the blue coat and the pink mane was standing directly across the glass from her.  Cup Cake's lips were moving when she lurched backwards, evidently more startled than Derpy.  Nevertheless, she swiftly smiled, her lips moving some more as she pointed at a tray of blueberry muffins beneath the glass counter.

Derpy smiled.  She flexed her right wing, stretched it, then retracted her muscles slowly until one sole feather stood out from the rest.

Cup Cake nodded dramatically with a knowing grin.  She reached beneath the counter, pulled a single muffin out, and wrapped the bottom half of it in candied tissue paper.  After laying it before the pegasus, the plump mare reached into a lower shelf, pulled out an abacus, and slid two beads to the far right before displaying it before Derpy.

Nodding, Derpy laid two bits onto the table, which Cup Cake gratefully swiped up in a blue hoof.  After sliding the bits into a jar, the mare smiled at Derpy and squatted in a pronounced curtsy.

Derpy returned an equally warm expression before cradling the muffin in an outstretched wing.  She took a bite out of it, instantly reveling in the crumbly goodness as it filled the depths of her mouth, electrifying her taste buds with a delicate spritz of cinnamon sugar that coated the blueberry bits with each subsequent nibble.

As she turned around and made her way out the bakery, she spotted movement from the table once more.  Derpy couldn't help but look up, and she was able to spot one of the two young mares crossing her eyes while mimicking a slack-jawed eating motion with her muzzle.  The pony across from her held a hoof over her grinning muzzle as her shoulders shook.  At last, both mares stared unabashedly at Derpy while the mare exited, those sickly plastered smiles refusing to wane.

When Derpy reached the nearby street corner, the muffin was half-eaten.  Only, all of the sudden, the rest of her morning breakfast no longer looked quite so appealing.  The mare's wing muscles hung limply and she sighed.  Seconds later, a dull pain reverberated across her skull.  Wincing, Derpy tugged at her blonde bangs until they covered her right scalp once more.  Then, with a soft exhale, she trotted across the street—

A strong hoof suddenly yanked her back with extreme force.  Derpy's jaw hung open as she spotted a massive wagon full of blacksmith parts speeding right past her, reeling so close that she felt the spray of dew-soaked dirt splattering across her quivering fetlocks.  She shook all over with timid breaths.  Then, smiling in relief, she turned towards her savior, only to lurch back from a suited businessstallion's angry, barking face.  His muzzle opened widely with sharp, black bursts as he pointed at her then gestured madly into the street where the wagon's dust still lingered.  All Derpy could do was tremble in place until his aphonic rant was over.  Then, with a stiff shrug of his shoulders, he picked his suitcase back up in his tense jaws and trotted across the street once it was clear of traffic.

Derpy bit her lip.  She looked down at the ground, spotting where the muffin had fallen into a crumbly mess along the edge of a muddy ditch.  Squinting her right eye shut, she aimed carefully for the clouds, flapped her wings, and made her way swiftly for the Ponyville Post Office on the far side of town.

Once there, it wasn't long before Derpy spotted her supervisor, who was customarily waving a wild forelimb.  Without wasting any time, she trotted swiftly across the bustling parcel center, where a dull-faced mare hoofed Derpy a mail-bag full of stamped envelopes and tiny paper-wrapped packages.  Derpy strung the satchel around her shoulders without ceremony, along with a thick pad of paper and some pens.  Then, turning completely around, she squinted through her left eye until she was absolutely certain she had formulated a path across the hazy gray office full of moving, heaving, shuffling bodies.  She trotted across the busy interior, nevertheless bumping once or twice into a passing flank, summoning agitated expressions in her distant peripheral.

Within seconds, however, Derpy was outside, once again embraced by the warm hug of a golden morning.  She took off immediately, curving her way westward across the balmy winds as she began her ritualistic sweep of the town, street by street and cottage by cottage.

As per usual, it was a simple task: matching the numbers and addresses on her envelopes with the appropriate mailboxes and apartments lingering beneath her.  Derpy Hooves descended upon the residences one road at a time.  Once grounded, she kept her left eye trained upon the sidewalk's edge, guiding her hooves straightforward as she dropped off letter after letter.  She only paused when the brightening sunlight of the day got to her, bringing a twitch to her eyes that magnified a lingering dull pain in her skull.  Determined as always, the mare encouraged herself forward, knowing that just a few stops away she would be on Booth Street, where the most dazzling rose gardens lingered.

Derpy's rounds hit a slight snag, however, when she stumbled upon Roseluck talking with Daisy directly in front of Roseluck's mailbox.  Derpy nevertheless smiled, reaching deep into her mailbag and pulling out the envelope with Roseluck's name on it.  When she attempted hoofing it out to the mare, Roseluck merely gave her a side-glance, holding up a hoof as she looked directly at Daisy again, her muzzle moving rapidly while the other pony opened her mouth with a heavy exhale of humored breaths.

Patient, Derpy stood in place, gripping the envelope in the crook of her hoof.  Her eyes wandered in opposite directions—until her right one caught colorful, flouncing bodies.  With a curious breath, Derpy tilted her head to the right, aiming her left eye at the neighbor's yard.  Four tiny foals were galloping in the springy emerald lawn, playing tag.  The noonday sun glinted off their young, silken manes, and the shadows caught the dimples across their spritely faces at just the right angle to magnify their innocent, laughing grins.  When one foal got caught, the others tackled him into the dirt, rolling around, teeth bright, white, and flashing.

Derpy smiled, exhaling.  Just then, a peach hoof waved directly in front of her muzzle, cutting the sunlight into strobe-light flickers.  The pegasus instantly winced, teetering backwards as she clutched the right edge of her skull.  When her vision stopped fogging, she saw Roseluck's angry expression.  The mare mouthed something, then mouthed something again, pointing angrily at the envelope that Derpy was inadvertently dragging across the sidewalk.

With a fidgeting expression, Derpy held the mail out again.  Roseluck snatched it out of her timid grip with a vicious slap, then upturned her muzzle as she trotted up the front steps to her apartment, accompanied by Daisy.  With a dull sigh, Derpy flapped her wings and made for Booth Street around the corner, her nose wriggling for wont of beautiful floral scents.

The prevailing fragrance of lavender and rose bushes was of little respite to the mare, for as soon as Derpy landed on the first house, she was interrupted in the task of dropping off a tiny cardboard box by a wrinkled old mare with an even more wrinkled frown hobbling out her front door to interrupt her.  The geriatric pony's muzzle-skin flapped and wobbled as she spat and pointed an indignant hoof at Derpy, the package, and Derpy again.

Derpy waved a hoof, gnashing her teeth, but the elder equine kept gesturing and spitting wildly.  At last, with a dull sigh, Derpy whipped out her pad of paper and scribbled three words onto the sheet as neatly as her squinting vision would allow her.  Then, with an overly polite smile, she held the pad up for the elder to see.

This didn't calm the old mare at all.  In fact, she got even more red-faced, her wrinkles turning into dry little scarlet canyons that gnotted tightly around her flaring eyes.  Derpy fumbled with her pen, preparing to write again—only to have the mare snatch it out of her grasp along with the pad.  With quivering shoulders, the ornery pony hunched over, clasping the pen in the crook of her hoof and taking a veritable eternity to write down a single word.

Derpy exhaled slowly.  Another twinge of pain traversed her skull; she was finding it hard to resist all of the sudden.  So, with a desperate tilt, she pivoted her head towards the rose garden once again, filling her nasal cavities with nature's perfume.  Crimson petals bloomed lusciously in the afternoon glow.  Lady bugs crawled across the flowers' silken surfaces, their glossy shells like tiny globes that split to reveal gossamer wings as they took off into the humid air.  It was impossible for Derpy not to smile—that is, until she was receiving a face full of notepad.

Derpy winced, stumbling back as the air around her filled with fluttering leaves of paper.  She gawked at the elderly pony, who by this time was a furious mess, pointing an incriminating hoof at Derpy before waving her forelimbs left and right and spitting up a storm.  At last, the enraged equine thrusted her rear hoof out, attempting to kick the cardboard box across the sidewalk.  It only amounted to a tiny tap, but the gesture was venomous enough.  In the very next huff, she was storming her way back to the rustic apartment's front stoop at a blistering one-mile-per-hour.

Grimacing, Derpy lifted the box back up and waved it towards the building.  But it was too late; the front door had shut.  With a drooping sigh, Derpy lay one eye prolongedly upon the dirtied parcel, chewing on her bottom lip.  At last, with a scathing exhale, she stuffed the package angrily into the mailbox, scooped up as many sheets of paper as she could, and took off for the warm afternoon skies.

It wasn't until half-an-hour of furious wing-flaps had passed by that Derpy calmed down just enough to take true measure of the time.  Between the angled glint of the sun's rays and the miniscule weight to her mailbag, she surmised that she had actually gotten ahead in her rounds that day.  This meant she was afforded a moment of rest before dropping off her last package.

So, with very little ceremony, Derpy circled and circled until she hovered directly above a verdant green hilltop overlooking the northwest patches of farmland just outside Ponyville.  Here, she dropped, draping her body liberally over the pliable blades of grass until they tickled her fuzzy gray tummy.  Only once her chin was nestled in the hilltop's crest of soft soil—firmly anchoring her and her eyes—did she allow her body deflate with the mother of all sighs.

The mare's fragile breath rolled downhill, fluttering at the gossamer tips of dandelions and spreading the puffy seeds outward in a monochromatic spray.  Derpy's left eye squinted, following the powdery trail until the seeds disappeared amidst the bright blue horizon, a vanishing point that surrendered to jagged brown and white peaks as mountains loomed eternally in the Equestrian distance.

Between Derpy and forever, lustrous lakes loomed, their glassy surfaces rippling with untold life—above and beneath—like the rapid, flitting, winged things circling haloes above the dormant mare's blonde mane.  Derpy swiveled her good eye left and right, catching farmlands sliced into rows of fertile plots, their crops sprouting a homogenous assortment of sometimes green, sometimes brown, but all the time luscious vegetables.

Faraway villages loomed in the shadows of tall earthen ridges.  Roads stretched east and west in dazzling gold lines, connecting townships like arteries, all brimming in the soft navel of a glowing world that refused to stay still, but somehow shimmered, somehow scintillated, somehow danced just for her.

It was all such beautifully bittersweet grandeur to be alone with, and the weight of that returning epiphany finally squeezed the first of many hot tears out of Derpy's lopsided eyes, until they rolled off her quivering muzzle and delicately christened the soundless earth beneath her.  She sniffled, rubbing her lids, suddenly feeling an aching throb deep inside her chest—something that made her dreadfully miss her usual migraines.

There was still one package left to be delivered.  Derpy was many things, but she refused to be tardy.  So, steeling herself, she stood up atop the hill with a determined frown.  A timely wind blew at her bangs, drying her muzzle before she took one last glance into her mailbag.  A pink-wrapped package lay deep inside: small, delicate, and tied with an even more delicate bow.  Derpy hardly even had to look at the stamped address; the mailmare already knew where it was destined to go.

It took barely three minutes to arrive at the entrance to Carousel Boutique.  Landing before the ornate door and its diamond-shaped window, Derpy raised her hoof up to the lavender frame to knock.  She paused, however, mentally reminding herself how ornate and finely painted the building's wooden finish was.  Her left eye swam figure-eights until she discovered the doorbell.  She pressed her hoof to the button, mentally counted two and a half seconds, then released.

Half-a-minute later, the door opened.  Purple mane flouncing, Rarity poked her elegant head out.  A loose measuring ribbon was draped around her neck, and she was already smiling, her luscious lashes fluttering behind bejeweled spectacles.  Her lips moved in liquid fashion, smiling brighter. Suddenly, the unicorn cocked her head aside, her eyes glancing down towards Derpy's slack and empty satchel.  The fashionista tapped her delicate chin, squinting in sudden thought.

Derpy squirmed slightly in place, holding the pink package out further as her tail flicked anxiously.

But—just then—Rarity's muzzle beamed wide in a jubilant smile.  She opened the door the rest of the way and gestured for Derpy to step inside the sparkling Boutique.

Derpy Hooves merely bit her lip, glancing at the neighboring rooftops of Ponyville before swiveling her eyes once more in Rarity's direction.

Rarity pointed at Derpy's empty mailbag with a curious expression.  Her lips moved with six tight words, and her eyelashes fluttered once more.

Derpy shrugged, gave her empty bag a wave, then shook her head.

Grinning once more, Rarity waved again, emphatically this time.  She backtrotted, staying constantly two feet away from Derpy's final delivery in the mailmare's outstretched hoof.

With an inward sigh, Derpy Hooves trotted into the Boutique.  She nearly fainted from the intoxicating aroma of vanilla and jasmine.  She glanced left and right, fidgeting, for this was her first time actually stepping inside the place, and the glitter of the many fabulous dresses were playing an awful number on her optics.

Almost as if sensing this, Rarity gave the pegasus a soft tug with her magic.  Derpy gasped as she suddenly found herself ascending a raised dais, facing a comfortingly opaque wall.  Within seconds, the package was plucked telekinetically from her grasp, along with her satchel and notepad.  Before the mare's eyes could swivel at the right angles to make sense of the situation, she felt a soft velvet fabric being draped over her shoulders and flank.  With an honest jolt, Derpy looked straight down, spotting an earthen brown sheet being fitted to her upper body and hind quarters.  Muzzle twisted, she pivoted her face towards the unicorn to protest.

However, at this point, Rarity had a veritable arsenal of scissors, pens, straight edges, and pincushions floating all around the two mares in dense orbit, imprisoning them.  She waved a chiding hoof, looking at Derpy... looking through her as she draped on smaller swaths of velvet bergundies, reds, and soft green lace.

Squirming, Derpy's eyes rotated left and right as she began to shiver.  She felt the material sliding off her quivering shoulders and over coiled wingfeathers.  Just then, the softest of touches graced her chin, tilting her head towards the right so that her good eye faced the fashionista.  It was the exactness of the gesture that soothed Derpy still more than anything.

Rarity was smiling at her.  Her lips moved, pronouncing two words.  Then, with a tight look of concentration, she levitated a blue sheet by her side, sketching furiously and brilliantly across a dotted equine outline.  Her gaze danced a few more times between the two—the pony and the design—until at last she sported a proud grin.  In a blink, she fluttered her lashes, staring squarely into the left edge of Derpy's vision.  She smiled again—with friendlier dimples this time—and every other string of muzzle-movements that Rarity made ended with two pronounced syllables and a delicate swish of her tongue.

Somehow, this was enough to lull Derpy into a calm state.  However, a persistent throb of pain still issued across the pegasus' skull.  As if reading her mind, Rarity exhaled through pursed lips and rested a white hoof directly over Derpy's eyes, slowly lowering.  Derpy closed her lids on command, and she drifted there, alone in a fuzzy black world.

Only—she wasn't alone.  With gentle feathery brushes of velvet and silk, she felt the artist encircling her, wrapping her neatly with a magic shroud of dressmaking finesse.  Gentle vibrations fluttered against Derpy's bangs, lingering closer and further and closer as Derpy smelled traces of the elegant unicorn's apricot perfume.  At some point, the vibrations came more pronounced, accompanied by sporadic breaths.  Derpy realized that the entire time—be it thirty minutes, an hour, two hours; she couldn't tell—Rarity was talking to her, no doubt pontificating over the exquisite methods that the unicorn was employing to build a textile masterpiece around this unwitting pegasus ponyquin.

And then, without warning, the movement and the fluttering and the vibrations all stopped. Derpy lingered in place, feeling like a fuzzy bundle of feathers stuck in a lace cocoon.  Then, with gentle traces brushed against her fetlocks up to her chest, Rarity's hooves made their way to her face, gently tapping the square patch of fuzz between the pegasus' closed lids.  Slowly, Derpy obeyed, opening her left eye before following it with the swirling right.  Once the pain and the fog had cleared, the mare saw two angelic visages merging together like opposite fringes of a revolving kaleidoscope, until a singular image stood dead-center in the middle of a mirror.

Miss Hooves gasped, and her vision danced left and right until it once again found that center, and that center stared elegantly back—a pair of lopsided eyes being the only blemish marring what was otherwise an inexplicably scrumptious work of genius. Ribbons of green-laced red bands spun up Derpy's gray limbs like vines until they coalesced underneath a floaty bustle of converging forest-green and desert-brown velvets.  A series of scarlet bows dotted the skirt's hem, with a series of green-and-red ribbon trailing at the back, sparkling with dark amber sequins along the outer trim.

It was almost as if Rarity had sculpted the dress out of a clay bucket of rich soil and lush vegetation, only to then dip it all in a glittering cloud of ruby dust.  Derpy wasn't sure if she belonged anymore in the postal service or on a runway.  The sensation was almost as shocking as it was flattering, especially when she remembered the fact that Rarity had just dreamed it up within a minute of ushering the mare into her Boutique.

Gawking, the pegasus' eyes swiveled to the side, followed by her trembling face.  Rarity's smiling muzzle swam into view.  The fashionista sat on her haunches, clasping two forelimbs together as she cocked her head aside with an inquisitive expression.  She nodded, her lips moving in four syllables, over and over, more and more ardent.

Derpy swallowed a lump down her throat and nodded back, smiling.  Suddenly, Rarity lifted a hoof, then scooted over, tilting Derpy once more towards the mirror.  With a gentle tug of telekinesis, she raised Derpy's mane into an ornate bun, allowing the golden hair to stay that way through the sheer lift of magic alone.  Rarity craned her neck so that her reflection caught Derpy's eye beyond her own reflection.  Again, she pronounced four syllables.

Derpy smiled and smiled—until she saw the tell-tale edge of a scar along her right brow.  Immediately, that grin faded, and she watched in the mirror as one eye wandered far from the other, and then everything fogged yet again as her face drifted towards the stage below.

A warm breath brushed past her.  Two snow-white hooves clasped with her own.  With a tug, she was forced to look straight ahead.

Rarity gazed at her with the softest of smiles.  She mouthed a single syllable once, twice.  Finally, once she had gotten Derpy's full attention, she stepped back, pointed at the mare with her right hoof, then swiftly waved the same limb before her own face in one clock-wise sweep.  The gesture was accompanied with five swift syllables, then repeated right when Rarity performed the gesture again, all the while keeping eye contact with the mailmare.

Derpy had not expected this.  Her jaw dropped as she felt a delicious pain deep in her chest, just as she had felt it on the hilltop an hour or two before.  Sniffling, she turned to look into the mirror once again.  A fragile smile clung to her muzzle as she admired herself.  She wasn't aware of how much time had gone by—until suddenly she felt the dress being peeled off her in glimmering waves of magic.  With a woeful breath, she watched as Rarity neatly folded the dress in mid-air, then trotted off with it floating directly in front of her.

Gazing back at the mirror, Derpy saw her naked, gray, googly-eyed self.  She exhaled heavily, feeling the lump in her throat magnifying.  Seconds later, however, she sensed movement out the edge of her foggy vision.  Pivoting, she saw Rarity return, neatly tucking the dress into a long silvery box and tying the package up with a shiny blue ribbon.  Then, after a firm breath, she dropped the container in her two front limbs and held it out before Derpy.  Smiling.

Derpy's left eye blinked.  She leaned backwards, as if reeling from a hammer blow.  Incredulous, she shook her head.

Rarity smiled.  Rarity nodded.  Rarity held the container out further and further.

The mailmare was trembling at this point, her teeth gritting as she felt the glittering lengths of the Boutique merging as one around her.  But then Rarity crossed the distance between them, practically shoving the container into Derpy's grasp.  The fashionista's expression was momentarily stern, but it swiftly morphed back into an elegant smile as she nodded and nodded some more.

Biting her lip, Derpy clutched the dress container to her chest.  There was no way she could look at the unicorn now, for the tears had rendered her wandering eyes twice as useless.  The smile that accompanied them hung true, however, and she reached a hoof blindly forward through the fog, only to feel Rarity's dear embrace as the mare gave her the friendliest of nuzzles.  Rarity then held the mailmare's shoulders at forelegs' length, smiling as she gestured towards the bag.

Derpy nodded, finally swallowing that lump in her throat away to oblivion.  She felt a lingering toastiness to the fragrant air as Rarity magically lifted her mailbag for her.  When the satchel was close enough, Derpy slid the container in, smiled jubilantly, and made a polite exit.

That evening, long after Derpy had punched out at the post office, long after she had flown her happy way home, long after she had taken a long shower and an even longer soak...

She lay on her bed, reclined, allowing time and gravity to swivel her good eye until it was level with the chair seated across the bedroom from her.  There, she had draped the gown over the back of the furniture, having smoothed out its velvety length so that the fabric could best catch the moonlight shining in from the airy open window.

After several warm breaths and even warmer minutes of non-stop smiling, Derpy finally found the courage to stand up and trot across her soft carpet floor.  There, she lingered beside the chair, looking into the dress container that lay open on her vanity.  It was then and only then that she finally noticed something else that had been slid inside.  Breathless, Derpy reached in and pulled out a tiny pink package.  Rarity's name and address had been completely removed, replaced by the crude illustration of a cartoonishly dotted muffin.

Antsy, Derpy pulled the silk ribbon loose and opened the package altogether.  Inside, she found a scarlet hair-bow, its color practically identical to the bands that ran up the legs of her new and beautiful gown.  Breathless, the mare pivoted towards the mirror, squinting through her left eye.  She fastened the bow to her mane, just along the bangs.  To her exquisite delight, it covered the right side of her scalp quite strategically.  However, after a full minute of staring, she pulled her mane into a bun, placing the bow higher instead.  Taking a deep breath, she opened her right eye all the way, allowing it to swivel up at muzzle-level at the sacrifice of the left side of her vision.

And for the first time in as long as Derpy could remember, the mare didn't feel repulsed.  Her lingering smile couldn't possibly have meant anything else.
> Tomorrow
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The next morning, Derpy Hooves woke up yet again to the rhythmic tapping of the lever to her mattress.  She showered, shimmied, sighed, then flew her way—smiling—through the golden bands of the blossoming day.

Within an hour, she stood at the glass counter inside Sugarcube Corner.  Cup Cake was trotting up and the mailmare was reaching for her bit bag—

When two familiar figures jittered in the pegasus' peripheral vision.  Derpy glanced to her left in time to see the pair of young mares smiling, tittering, murmuring unknown things as they glanced mischievously her way.

Derpy softly exhaled.  When she turned back towards the counter, she spotted Cup Cake frowning at the two patrons.  The baker looked as though she was about to open her mouth with an angry breath—but Derpy distracted her with a gentle hoof-wave.  Once she had gotten Mrs. Cake's attention, she pointed at the pastries beneath the counter, then pulled out six bits.

The two young mares continued giggling at their table.  Suddenly, a petite shadow rolled across the pair.  They both looked up, and their smiles instantly faded as they blinked in confusion.

Derpy stood before them, her swiveling eyes glossy as she stretched her left wing out, offering two freshly-baked muffins.  A third one rested on her right wing.

The mares gawked at her, their muzzles agape.  A blush lingered between them as they exchanged nervous expressions, then looked at Derpy again.

Derpy only smiled harder, nodding as she stretched the wing with the two muffins closer to the mares.

The duo exchanged glances again.  Then, with meek smiles, they graciously accepted the offering.  Soon, they were scooting their chairs aside, offering Derpy room.

The mare sat down, immediately nibbling on her muffin with a contented smile.  She was vaguely aware of the two mares' muzzles moving, their lips a steady blur amidst the warm haze of the living, breathing world.  At some point, her good eye wandered up until it fixated on one mare's braided brown mane.  Swallowing a blueberry morsel down, Derpy exhaled, pointing at the hair-do with a bright grin.

The mares looked at her, then at the one pony's manestyle.  Smiling playfully, they pointed at the mare's head, then at Derpy.

Derpy nodded, grinning wide.

Over the next few minutes, the two mares stood around Derpy, licking their lips as they tied her scrappy blonde mane into neat, intricate twirls.  At last, after fluffing the front edges of her bangs, they stood back with proud smirks.  One mare even raised a hoof-mirror towards the pegasus, pronouncing a string of unintelligible words.

Intensely curious, Derpy simply took the mirror, clutching it before her.  A middle-aged mare with a princessy braid stared back.  It was so delightfully absurd that Derpy couldn't contain herself.  Her breathy giggle fogged up the glass in a cloudy gray burst, and once the mist had faded, the reflections of two friendly faces were giggling too, loud and clear.

The sun was going down which meant that a sheriff’s duty was done for the day. Maretime Bay Day was a success, magic was stabilised and every pony enjoyed the festivities. With Hitch’s office locked up and everything tided away for the day, the sheriff of Maretime Bay could now go and get some sleep. However, sleep would have to wait as the sheriff of Maretime Bay had also, unexpectantly, become a daddy on the same day. Hitch was not the father of a pony, however.

“Okay, Sparky. Here comes the pegasus,” Hitch waved the spoonful of soft food around in the air with a hoof, causing the baby dragon to giggle and wave his little claws around. His small wings flapped wildly despite him being restricted to a raised chair. 

“Now open wide,” Hitch cooed as he directed the spoon towards the baby dragon’s mouth. Sparky did as his new dad instructed him to do and both of them grinned as Sparky swallowed. It was then that the sheriff noticed the dragon squirm in her raised chair. Lifting Sparky up, he held her in a position so that her head rested on his shoulder. With a gentle pat, Sparky released a satisfying burp and Hitch breathed a sigh of relief. He was lucky that little Sparky couldn’t breathe fire. Yet. 

Glancing over towards the window, he noticed that the sun was quickly lowering over the waters of the sea. He wiped Sparky’s mouth clean with a napkin and placed him on his back, her tiny claws grabbing his coat so as not to fall off. Hitch knew he was going to get a lot of red scratch marks until she was able to walk by herself.  

“Bath time!” Hitch said as he plugged the bathtub and let the water run. Mixing the bath water with bubbly liquid, he checked the temperature before turning the tap off and placing the dragon into the water. Some bubbles got into Sparky’s nose, causing her to sneeze. Hitch chuckled as he began scrubbing her with a sponge.

“Rubby-dub-dub,” Hitch giggled as he leaned forward with a silly face. Sparky reached forward with her claws outstretched and grabbed Hitch by the muzzle. 

“Ow-ow-ow! No, Sparky,” Hitch groaned, “I should really teach you not to grab a pony’s nose.” Despite the pain, Hitch still laughed through it all. His tough sheriff face crumbled like a card tower at the sight of Sparky's face. 

“Aw, but I can’t stay mad at you for long,” Hitch cooed again as he poured some shampoo into a hoof and massaged it into Sparky’s scales.

“Hope Sunny can rummage through her dad’s old research papers and find out more about you and dragons,” Hitch talked to himself as he continued to give Sparky his bath, “I want you to be a big strong dragon when you grow up and I can’t do that without knowing how to raise you properly.”

Hitch continued to wash Sparky for several more minutes until the bubbles were all gone and all that was left was a squeaky clean dragon in the tub.

“There you go. All squeaky clean.” Hitch 

“Let’s get you ready for bed, okay?” Hitch commented as he carried Sparky towards the bathroom. Sunny was kind enough to give him a new toothbrush for Sparky. Gently opening Sparky’s mouth, Hitch sat down and brushed Sparky’s teeth with one hoof and his own in another. Sparky would often try to bite the intruding instrument, Hitch was gentle as he reached every nook and cranny in Sparky’s mouth. 

“Ah, ah, ah,” Hitch shook his head, “No bitey.” 

Soon it was time for bed. Hitch tucked her in and then slipped under the covers as well. Both of them yawned and Hitch nuzzled the baby dragon on the top of his head.

“Goodnight, my little Sparky.”

Hitch didn’t know how long he was asleep when there was a sound coming from his bedroom window. The sound of something tapping against the glass. Grumbling and wiping away the sleep from his eyes. Hitch carefully moved away from the sleeping dragon and crept silently towards the window. Hitch’s eyes grew large as he spotted a pair of pegasnails flapping outside. Hitch carefully opened the window, allowing the cold night air to come in. This caused him to shiver and Sparky to dig deeper into the blanket to find more warmth against the cold sea breeze blowing in. 

“Cold night,” Hitch said to the two flying snails who spoke in chirps. Hitch was still amazed that he could speak to critters now that earth ponies have magic too. The pegasnails talked in their chirps again. Hitch nodded and looked towards the bed. 

“I suppose you can stay here for the night,” Hitch suggested. That was all they needed to hear as the pair of them flew through the open window and made themselves comfortable, retreating into their shells to avoid getting slime over the bed. Hitch chuckled quietly as he watched the spectacle in front of him.

“A sheriff always puts the citizens’ needs before his own,” He told himself as he shut the window and crept carefully back to bed. He managed to squeeze himself in and soon they were all fast asleep. 

It was sometime during the night that Hitch heard the sound of hard knocking on the window again. Hitch tried his best to ignore whatever critter was knocking this late into the night, but soon it was too much to bear. Plus, the knocks might disturb little Sparky. Hitch didn’t want to deal with a crying baby dragon in the middle of the night. That would be worse than the knocking on the glass. 

Sighing, Hitch got up and went to see who was creating all the ruckus. His eyes rolled around in their sockets when he saw another two critters outside the window. A bunnycorn and unicoon somehow managed to climb to the top of the building and were now waiting for Hitch to answer the window. Hitch opened the window again and gave a strained smile at the two of them.

“Cold night? I assume you want to crash here for the night, eh?” Hitch asked drearily, already knowing their answer. 

The two of them nodded and Hitch stepped aside as they jumped down to the bedroom floor. With the bunnycorn hopping across the floor and unicoon crawling their way towards the bed, Hitch closed the window again and followed the two of them. All three of them got in and made themselves comfortable. 

“Why do I feel like this is going to happen-“

Another knock at the window interrupted him. 
 
“Again,” Hitch groaned as he dragged a hoof across his face. He turned around to find the familiar faces of the two seagulls and McSnipps Alot the crab. The two critters that were with Hitch before all the crazy magic business started. Hitch chose to not say a word as he opened the window and stood aside with a hoof outstretched. 

“Be my guest. You’re not the first,” Was all that he said. The three of them nodded their heads in thanks as the two seagulls flew over to the bed, choosing to roost at the best posts on either side. McSnipps Alot scurried across the floor and made tucked himself in. Hitch managed to chuckle to himself as he closed the window one final time. he counted how many critters were there, plus himself and it came back with a grand total of seven critters, one baby dragon and a stallion sleeping together for the night. 

Hitch found himself up to the edge of the bed as he carefully squeezed in with all the other critters. Grumbling to himself about how he is going to get a good night’s sleep when there was another busy day of sheriff duties, he gave up and, somehow managed to close his eyes and soon nine creatures were fast asleep. 
Then Sparky shifted position, causing McSnipps Alot to change position and causing the bunnycorn and then the pegasnails to be shoved along. A domino effect soon occurred down the line of sleeping creatures until it reached Hitch. The poor stallion was pushed hard enough to drop onto the floor with a loud thump.

Groaning and rubbing his sore flank, Hitch got up and looked at the critters and baby dragon, all sleeping peacefully and unaware that their favourite stallion just got pushed off his own bed. 

“Somehow, I knew that was going to happen, and yet I was unaware at the same time,” Hitch shook his head. He sighed as his eyes took in the peculiar sight in front of him.

“Oh well,” Hitch muttered, “Of all the crazy things that have happened to me since magic returned, this is the most adorable though.”

Hitch thought long and hard about what he could do before giving up and walked toward his wardrobe. Taking out his sleeping bag, pillow and extra-thick blanket, he positioned everything next to his bed and slid in. Since he was now at ground level, he could make out the dark shapes of the sleeping critters on his bed. Hitch smiled at his animal friends all sleeping peacefully and snuggled against each other. 

Remembering his new baby dragon, he carefully scooped her up and placed him in the sleeping bag with him. He took one last look at the occupied bed before shaking his head and chuckling to himself. 
Sometimes, being a critter magnet has its downsides, but the sheriff admitted it was still adorable. What antics they will get him into, alongside Sparky, well, he could only wonder. 

“A sheriff puts his citizens before himself,” Hitch said as a yawn escaped from his mouth, “Goodnight, every critter. You too, Sparky. I will make breakfast for all of us in the morning.”

He gave each one a small kiss on their heads, beaks and shells before snuggling into his sleeping bag, Sparky hugging him for warmth. 

All he can do now is hope that none of them drools over the side.

The first rays of the sun streamed through the curtains, waking up the mare who was lying on the bed. With a groan, she pulled the blanket over herself and tried to go back to sleep, but her efforts were thwarted when the alarm clock on her nightstand began to blare. After futilely trying to drown out the strident noise, the mare gave up and accepted her defeat, getting up from the bed and standing on her four hooves, turning off the damn device.

She was an earth pony, with her cream colored fur and a burgundy mane, with a small pink stripe. Her cutie mark was a rose, matching her name, Roseluck. The mare yawned and she left her room, down the hall to the stairs that led to the first floor of the house, specifically, to the kitchen, where she turned on the coffee pot.

She placed three different cups on the counter and took out the can of milk and sugar, preparing everything for her friends when they came down for breakfast. Once the coffee was ready, Rose put on her mug, poured herself milk and two tablespoons of sugar, and sat at the kitchen table, allowing the caffeine to jump-start her system. After a few minutes, the sound of hoofbeats came from the stairs, and soon after, one of her best friends, Lily Valley, appeared. She was, like Roseluck, an earth pony, with pink fur and a golden mane, her cutie mark was a trio of white lilies. Like her friend that very morning, she groggily moved toward the steaming coffee pot.

"Good morning" she murmured as she started to put on the coffee.

"Good morning, Lily" Rose said with a smile. "Ready for today?"

"Uh-huh...I've got my suitcase ready" she muttered, putting down four spoonfuls of sugar. "And Daisy took care of safely packing the flowers, so we don't have to worry about that."

"Remind me to thank her."

"It would be enough for me if you always make me coffee" said Daisy's voice from the stairs. "Seriously, it would help a lot."

Daisy was, like her two friends, an earth pony, with pink fur and a lime green mane, her cutie mark depicting two daisies.

"I'm afraid that can't be" Roseluck said with a small laugh. "We had already agreed to share that task."

"Besides, it's not impossible," Lily argued as she sat down. "You only have to get up a few minutes earlier, it's not such a big problem."

"Yeah, but it gives me more time to sleep."

Daisy walked over to the coffeepot and put her cup on, then sat down next to her friends.

"Did you remember to tell everypony that the flower shop would be closed today?" Lily asked after taking a sip of her coffee.

"Yes" Roseluck replied. "I brought the flowers to our garden, asked Cheerilee to stop by when she could to water the plants, closed the stall and informed Mayor Mare, and left a sign at the stall to let the ponies know we're closing. If somepony places an order with us, we'll have it in the mailbox when we get back."

"Perfect, in that case, let's finish breakfast and get ready to catch the train, I don't want to be late."

"Lily, the exhibition is tomorrow, don't be so nervous" Daisy said as she rolled her eyes, to which her friend frowned at her.

"Yeah, but I don't know if the flowers will last that long locked up in boxes."

"For Celestia's sake, you know those boxes are made to hold flowers," Daisy muttered back.

Roseluck watched her friends' verbal exchange in silence, finishing her cup and getting up to go to the bathroom, quickly being noticed by Daisy.

"Hey! It's my turn to take a shower first."

"To have taken less time with your coffee" Rose said as she stuck her tongue out at her mockingly. "Besides, time is running out, we must hurry, miss 'I spend half an hour in the bathroom'."

Daisy looked away from her, muttering to herself that she was entitled to a little pampering, while Roseluck laughed and went upstairs to prepare for the long train ride.



Manehattan, the city that never sleeps, and that year, the venue for the 34th edition of the Equestria Flower Show, an exhibition made so that the best gardeners in the country could present their plants, whether they be flowers, cacti, bonsai... Roseluck and her friends always performed in the middle category, since despite not being rookies, they did not have the talent to enter the major leagues, where the gardeners not only showed the care they put into their plants and how beautiful they were, they also created true works of art. Hedges with various shapes, life-size statues made of flowers, last year the first place went to a scale model of the city of Canterlot made with flowers of all kinds.

This year, the event would be in the garden of the Alicorn Palace hotel, for a whole week. On Monday for the beginner category, on Tuesday and Wednesday for the intermediate category, on Thursday and Friday for the major leagues, and on Saturday the awards ceremony. Roseluck loved this event because it was an escape from her boring life in Ponyville, since, although her passion was gardening, after all it represented her cutie mark, repeating the same routine every day would eventually tire anypony out. 

In fact, the most exciting event she had ever experienced (not counting the return of Nightmare Moon or Discord) was almost six months ago when a stampede of rabbits destroyed their flower garden, and more than exciting it was devastating, after all, she and her friends depended on those flowers to pay their rent. Luckily, Twilight offered (rather, begged) them to accept half of her salary from Celestia and buy the lost flowers herself as compensation for what Applejack did, who offered them a discount on Apple Family products for two months.

After a half-day trip by train, they finally arrived at the hotel, and after drawing lots, Roseluck was chosen to be in charge of carrying the flowers that they had brought to the plot that the organization of the event had given them. She spent a full hour taking the pots out of their boxes and arranging them in such a way that they would stand out and draw attention to the naked eye. Satisfied with her work, she looked around, studying the other plots with ponies of all three breeds, there were even a few griffins and zebras, putting up their own pots, all watched over by a security team to make sure the contestants didn't try to sabotage each other.

Roseluck focused on the security team, then on the pots, and after feeling her stomach growl, she considered that she could go get something to eat and then go rest in the room that had been given to her and her friends. Humming cheerfully, she walked toward the hotel entrance, admiring the flowers the other contestants had brought, but her attention was quickly drawn to one pony in particular. It was an earth pony stallion, walking with a slow, unsteady step, pulling a small carriage with several pots filled with flowers.

Roseluck looked at him a little worried, since the pony was moving erratically, and as they got closer, she noticed the huge dark circles in his eyes. At one point, the stallion tripped and fell forward, crashing to the ground. The mare quickly went over to help the poor pony, and as she did so, she noticed that he not only had dark circles under his eyes, but his eyes were bloodshot as well.

"Are you okay?" she said as she helped him up, her eyes drifting to the pots to make sure none of his flowers had gone bad.

"Yes, yes... Thank you" he said, his voice weak but trying to sound friendly. "It was just a little dizziness."

Roseluck bit her lip as she studied the pony a little better.

"Maybe I'm messing where I'm not called, but you should see a doctor, you don't look very healthy."

"I know" the earth pony said with a sigh. "But I'm fine, I just haven't been able to sleep well lately, but thanks for asking."

Roseluck gave the pony a hesitant look before nodding and allowing him to continue on his way to his plot. After watching him for a few moments, she resumed her walk, already discarding the meeting. At that moment, what worried her most was the hunger and tiredness that a long day had caused her, and she really wanted to go to bed, tomorrow would be a great day, even if their flowers would not be analyzed until Tuesday.



Roseluck woke up slowly, shifting in her bed and yawning as she stretched. Her eyes went to the clock that she hung on the wall of the room that she shared with her friends, noticing that it was 7:50 am. Yawning again, she stood up, stretching her muscles a bit more before looking at the other two beds, seeing that only Daisy was in hers, Lily surely already downstairs for breakfast and to take a look at the flowers.

Roseluck went to the window, pushing aside the curtain a little to look out over the streets of Manehattan, the morning rays of the sun filtering through the buildings, enveloping the sidewalks in shadow, lined with dozens of ponies, and on the roads passed carriages going from one place to another. It was a big change from Ponyville, and the mare was always fascinated by the sight. That morning, however, she noticed something she had never seen before, something placed in one of the corners.

Squinting, she tried to make out the object in the distance, and if she had to guess, it resembled a blue phone booth, something that puzzled her. Those booths had not been very common, not even in the city that saw them born, Manehattan itself, and their magical communication technology was obsolete, since they could only communicate with stations that had the necessary arcane antennas, and to top it off, it could only be within a radius of two kilometers, and in a city as big as the metropolis that never slept, it was unfeasible. Even now, Roseluck didn't know of communication technologies that used magical phone lines, since they were superseded by radio, though the common pony still used letters. Long-distance communication was still in development.

"Will you close the curtain, please?" said Daisy's sleepy, annoyed voice, snapping Roseluck out of her thoughts.

Taking one last look at the cabin, Roseluck turned and looked at her friend with a smile.

"Don't complain so much, there isn't so much clarity either."

"It's still too much" she murmured as she covered herself with the blanket, making Roseluck laugh.

"Come on, we have to help Lily."

"The flowers aren't going to move anywhere, I don't see what we painted there" growled the mare as she looked at her friend, who shrugged her shoulders.

"I don't know, but we have to go. Besides, I want to have breakfast."

With that, she went into the bathroom to get ready while Daisy groaned in exhaustion and tried to fully wake up, out of the three of them, she had the worst time in the mornings. 

Twenty minutes later, Roseluck entered the hotel's cafeteria, in an area separate from the buffet, and she was alone, since Daisy was still in the bathroom and told her that she could go and she would catch up with her later. There were already several ponies there, most of them contestants or customers who couldn't afford the all-inclusive buffet, all having their breakfasts. The mare sat down at a table overlooking the pool, wondering not for the first time if she should pay to be able to spend more days there and thus have access to the areas reserved only for clients.

Her ears twitched as she detected the sound of hoofbeats approaching, and turning her head, she saw a pegasus mare approach with a smile, but there was something that bothered Rose. Like the pony from the day before, this mare had a wobbly gait, dark circles under her eyes, and bloodshot eyes, which put her on alert. Perhaps it was some kind of disease? She now regretted not being aware of the Manehattan news.

"Are you okay?" she asked when the mare was close enough to her, not allowing her to speak.

The pegasus blinked in surprise before giving her a slightly weaker smile and speaking in a weakened tone of voice.

"Yes, yes... Thank you, I just haven't been able to sleep well lately, but thanks for asking."

"It's strange, yesterday a pony told me exactly the same thing."

"Really?" she asked the mare as she produced a menu and notepad from under her right wing, placing the menu on the table. "Well, you shouldn't worry too much, it's probably just a coincidence."

Roseluck regarded the mare with a raised eyebrow before nodding. Even though something inside her told her that something was off, she dismissed it as her general boredom and her desire to go on an adventure and not look at it from the outside like she had in the release of Nightmare Moon and Discord.

"What will you drink?" said the mare as she put a pencil in her mouth to write.

Roseluck turned her attention to the menu, looking at the various dishes offered for breakfast, thinking of something that Daisy would like. Since the organization of the event paid for their accommodation and meals, she decided on a couple of well-loaded dishes to start the day with energy, Celestia knew that her friend needed it.

"Give me a plate of caramel waffles, a plate of eggs and fried hay, and two juices, one apple and one peach."

The pegasus nodded, giving her one last smile before picking up the menu and walking away from her with the same shaky step, but luckily, she didn't fall to the ground and kept her balance. Roseluck watched her for a few more seconds before focusing on the rest of the room, noticing something that set off her alarms again. Most of the ponies she watched also sported bags under their eyes, the ones that stood up had that wobbly gait, and if she had to bet, they had bloodshot eyes.

"Did you order my breakfast?" Daisy's voice said from behind her, snapping her out of her thoughts.

Roseluck turned to look at her friend, who looked more presentable than she had that morning.

"Yes, a plate of fried hay and eggs."

"You know me well" Daisy said with a smile as she sat down.

"Of course I know my best friend" Roseluck said with a smile, making Daisy smile.

"That will be a blow to Lily."

"I don't think so, she's my sister from another mother."

"Ouch, cheap shot."

The two laughed at their exchange before calming down and speaking more calmly. But despite being with one of her best friends, Roseluck kept glancing at the other ponies, those who looked sick.

"Something happens?" Daisy said, snapping Rose out of her thoughts.

"No, why?"

"It's just that you seem distracted" Daisy commented with a raised eyebrow. "What happen?"

"Well…" Roseluck looked back at the ponies doubtfully before replying. "Haven't you noticed anything unusual?"

Daisy frowned, considering her response before shrugging and shaking her head.

"No, nothing out of the ordinary."

"Haven't you noticed that there are ponies that look sick?" Roseluck asked insistently. "Yesterday a pony fell to the ground, he was dizzy and looked like he hadn't slept at all, and this morning I saw the waitress with the same symptoms."

Daisy frowned, glancing from her around the cafeteria and noticing for the first time the ponies Roseluck mentioned.

"Maybe you're exaggerating. I mean, it could be equine flu, we're at the time."

"It's not equine flu," Roseluck snorted. "I've been through the flu, and so have you, and you know as well as I do that this isn't equine flu."

"Equine flu makes you dizzy and exhausted, which can look like lack of sleep" said Daisy with conviction, before looking worriedly at the other ponies. "I hope nopony infects me, the flu makes me feel terrible."

Roseluck snorted and looked away from her friend. Maybe she was right and she was just exaggerating, but there was still a little voice in her mind that warned her that something was up, something very wrong.



After passing through the cafeteria, both mares went out into the garden and headed to their assigned plot, where Lily was finishing watering the plants.

"You got up too early to water the plants, didn't you?" Daisy said with a raised eyebrow, to which Lily rolled her eyes.

"We need to keep the plants as perfect as possible for Tuesday."

"Have you had breakfast?" Roseluck interjected, making Lily groan in frustration.

"Yes I do."

"You better, I don't want it to happen like last year."

"For the last time, Daisy, it was only ONE time."

"Uh-huh, but we still had to carry your unconscious body to the bed."

Lily growled to herself, grumbling as she focused on the flowers in front of her. After a little innocent laugh, Daisy went over to check the flowers as well, analyzing which ones should be trimmed and making sure the petals were in perfect condition. Roseluck went to work as well, but stopped when she heard a crash behind her, and turning from her, her eyes widened with concern.

A unicorn stallion had passed out on the paddock in front of their plot, knocking over some of his pots in the process, breaking one of them. She quickly walked over to make sure he was okay as her friends did the same, being surrounded by a small number of onlookers.

"Hey, wake up!" Roseluck yelled as she crouched down beside the pony and turned him around, seeing his face.

His eyes, hidden behind his lids, moved from side to side, he had deep bags under his eyes and his fur was drenched in sweat. Lily replaced the fallen pots while Daisy pushed the broken pieces away from the stallion, looking at him worriedly.

"He's okay?"

"I don't know" Roseluck said, still not taking her eyes off the pony, then looking at the ponies present. "Is there a doctor around here?"

The ponies looked at each other worriedly, shaking their heads, but their attention was quickly drawn back to the fallen pony, who was already opening his eyes. Roseluck sighed in relief, but she frowned at the sight of his bloodshot eyes. Trying to ignore that, put on her best friendly smile.

"Are you okay? Do you want us to call an ambulance?"

The pony blinked a bit, trying to get his bearings, before looking at the mare. After a few tense seconds, he shook his head.

"No, no... Thanks. It was just a little dizziness."

"Are you sure?" Lily said.

"I'm fine, I just have n't been able to sleep well lately, but thanks for asking" said the pony as he stood up on his trembling hooves, helped by Roseluck.

The mare frowned, feeling a strong sense of déjà vu.

"That's what a pony told me this morning."

The pony blinked, looking at Roseluck in confusion.

"Really? Well, you shouldn't worry too much, it's probably just a coincidence."

Rather than relax, Roseluck became even more restless. If she had already been suspicious when noticing that several ponies had the same symptoms, being told the same words was already a sure sign that something really terrible was happening. Before she could voice her suspicions, the stallion turned back to his pots, groaning in despair at the disaster of one of them, using his magic to grab the fallen bouquet, still with a good mound of soil attached by its roots.

"Thanks for the help, but I have to go see if I can save these flowers."

"Are you sure you're okay?" Lily said with concern, to which the stallion nodded.

"Yes, it was just a little dizziness."

Once again, the same words, causing Roseluck to frown even more.

"Let me come with you, sir" said a pegasus mare, dressed in the hotel's concierge uniform, to which the pony shook his head.

"No, no, no need…" the pony was silent for a few seconds before nodding. "Actually, yes, I could use the help."

Roseluck watched as the unicorn walked away from her along with the concierge, and the group of ponies dispersed, leaving only her and her friends.

"Poor pony, the flu hit him hard" Daisy commented.

"This isn't the flu," Roseluck confirmed with conviction.

"And what else can it be?" Lily asked tilting her head to the side.

"I…I don't know, but it's not the flu."

"Rose, you're exaggerating things" said Daisy as she rolled her eyes. "It's just an outbreak of equine flu."

"It's not," Roseluck protested with a little swipe of her hoof. "That pony said the exact same words to me as the waitress this morning and the pony I ran into yesterday."

"Well, the symptoms are similar" Lily argued. "It's normal that their phrases are similar."

"They don't look alike, they are exactly the same, word for word."

"Do you have any proof?" Daisy asked with a raised eyebrow, and seeing that her friend was silent, she went to their plot. "In that case, let's drop the subject, I want to finish soon to go see the rest of the exhibits."

Lily nodded and followed her friend, leaving Roseluck alone, who scowled at her friends.

"There's something going on here, I know" she muttered to herself.

"I think so" said a voice behind her, making her jump.

Turning, she saw an earth pony stallion surveying the patch of land that belonged to the pony. He had light brown fur, with a mane in a darker shade. He was wearing a jacket the same color as his mane, a green tie, and his cutie mark was an hourglass. The pony turned and regarded Roseluck with a smile.

"You're the first pony to notice it, congratulations. The rest dismiss it as equine flu or some other harmless illness."

Roseluck blinked in surprise, glancing at her friends, still busy, and approaching the stallion.

"Do you know what's going on?"

"Yup" he said with a smile. "But that is not something that should matter to you, that should matter to me. Go and enjoy this event while I take care of everything."

Roseluck looked at the pony doubtfully before speaking.

"We are in danger?" she asked, watching the pony's smile fade a few seconds before turning back to his.

"If I wasn't here, it would be a resounding yes, but I'm here, so you don't have to worry" he said with a smile as he started to walk away. "Enjoy the event and don't worry about a thing."

Roseluck watched as the stallion walked away, disappearing among the ponies. With a sigh, she walked over to her friends, praying he was right.

The little town of Ponyville, despite the insane things that seem to happen there, had always been a place one could enjoy a peaceful life. But with the new School of Friendship Princess Twilight and her friends had recently opened, the town's populace had grown tenfold. Students of the school, when classes weren't in session, spent their free time hanging around in the town, turning the place into an active community.

As such, it wasn't anypony's surprise when a train rolled in carrying a bunch of ponies wanting to see the sights of Ponyville. The engine came to a stop and unleashed a burst of steam and smoke as the ponies on board disembarked, only for a certain pegasus wearing a set of armor and carrying a shield on his back. As he stepped off, he looked back at the creation in wonder. "Such an amazing creature," he stated as the train unleashed a loud whistle and another burst of steam. "This iron dragon is certainly incredible."

The last of the new passengers finished boarding and the train began to pull away, the pegasus watching in amazement as it disappeared down the tracks. With it gone, the pony turned back to the town and sighed. "This place has certainly gotten a lot more lively over the last thousand years." He spread his wings and took to the sky, unaware that many ponies were watching him, wondering why he was wearing such old looking armor.

He continued to glance around, only to see a certain building right next to the castle of friendship. "So, that is the School of Friendship," he commented as he flew down, "Wonder what insane happenings are going on in there."





In the weeks since the School of Friendship had reopened, it really had become a great place to live and learn about friendship. The classes were all fun now, such as Rainbow Dash's class. "Alright class," the mare smirked as she flew into the room with another pegasus. "I'd like to introduce you all to my assistant for the day: Soarin."

"Sup everypony," Soarin replied as he waved at them. "Glad to be here, and happy to help you all in any way I can." He and Rainbow shared a grin as Rainbow grabbed a ball and threw it to one of her students.

"Alright, let's do some passing drills to build teamwork. Only you can't tell the pony you're passing it to that that's what you're gonna do. This is all about body language and learning to understand one another without words. And...go!" The students began passing the ball to one another, locking eyes as they did this. It was quickly proving to be effective, Rainbow and Soarin high-hooving at the sight.

In another class, Pinkie was showing her students a fun time by teaching them how to bake a bunch of cupcakes. The point of this lesson was to make a cupcake that somepony else in the class would enjoy, the group making different flavors that their partners would love. Applejack's class was working on a woodworking project, while Rarity's were working on stitch work and Fluttershy's were looking after some baby animals.

Meanwhile, Flash's class watched as Fire Heart stepped into the center of the room. "Alright class," the teacher said as he touched the crystal. "Today's lesson is about listening to each other and putting your trust in them, even when you can't see what they're doing to try and help you." The crystal glowed and a bunch of walls appeared within the room, forming a large maze around Heart before they disappeared. "In this exercise, the one working through the maze won't be able to see the walls, but their partner will, so they'll be in charge of directing them."

"Wait," Heart spoke up, "Who's my partner again?"

"Take two steps forward and then turn left," Ace's voice replied. The young jakhowl was staring a holographic screen with a layout of the maze and a red triangle that indicated Heart's location.

"Seriously? You gave me Ace? He gets lost in town all the time."

"Remember Heart," Flash responded, "This is all about building trust. You've gotta trust that Ace will guide you through the maze properly."

"Fine..." Heart sighed before walking left, only to hit an invisible wall, "OW!" He staggered back, turning to glare at Ace. "What the heck?! You said to go left!"

"But before that, I said take two steps forward."

Heart sighed and began to walk forward, only to slam into the wall again. "Ow!" He turned back to Ace, "Seriously?!"

"You changed direction. Turn ninety degrees to your left, then take two steps forward." Flash and the other students couldn't help but laugh at the sight, watching Heart hit wall after wall. And when he eventually stepped out of the maze, he had a lot of bruises on his face.

"That sucked," he moaned while the others laughed again.

"Okay, next pair."

The rest of the lesson went on in the same way, different methods of success for each team. And when the bell finally rang, the training room returned to its normal state. "Good lesson everypony. Be sure to remember what you learned today." They all nodded and headed outside while Flash remained in the class to write a report about the day's classes for Twilight.

"The one thing about this job I don't enjoy," he moaned while using the crystal to create a desk that he could write on. But before he could start writing anything, Heart rushed into the room.

"Flash!" He exclaimed, "You won't believe who's in the courtyard!" Flash raised an eyebrow at this, Heart gesturing him to follow. They soon left the room, only for the defender to go wide-eyed at a certain sight.

"Flash Magnus?" He asked, seeing one of the pillars of harmony standing beside the fountain.

"Ah, Flash Sentry." He responded while walking over, "It's good to see you again." He held out a hoof, Flash taking it.

"Same. But what are you doing here?"

"I was in town, and was curious to see what this school was all about."

Flash nodded, "Well, it's good to see you." He turned to the students, "Every-creature, please say hello to Flash Magnus. One of the ponies responsible for creating the Tree of Harmony, which is where the Elements you're all learning about come from." The students all went wide-eyed at this as Magnus waved at them. "Come on. I'm sure Twilight will be interested in seeing you again."

Magnus nodded and the pair headed to the headmare's office. As it turned out, Twilight was ecstatic to see him. "I'm happy that one of the pillars has taken an interest in my school!" the alicorn cheered they stood in her office. "How are the other pillars doing by the way?"

"They're all doing great," Magnus replied, "Starswirl is still learning about this modern world, but most of the others have chosen to settle down. Stygian's working on a book about his experiences during his...darker days, and the others have all returned to their homelands to make new lives for themselves."

"What about you?" Flash asked, "I don't think your legend ever stated where you come from."

"Nowhere special," Magnus shrugged, "Honestly, I'm still looking for a place to settle down. I never really had a home before I joined the Royal Legion since my parents were nomadic. I join the legion quite young, so my entire life has been constantly travelling."

"I see," Twilight responded, "So finding a place to call one's own must be tricky. Is that why you've come to Ponyville? Are you thinking of living here?"

"Well...not really," Magnus replied, "I just happened to be passing through and decided to see what your school was all about. If you're teaching others to defend themselves against evil, then this is a place I have a lot of interest in."

"Why does everypony believe that's what this school is here for?" Flash asked Twilight, the princess shrugging.

"Well, teaching our students to defend themselves isn't the most important point..." she told Magnus. "This school was built to help strengthen the friendships of Equestria in a hope that those friendships can help the kingdoms of all races thrive."

"I see," Magnus nodded. "And these other races are all those that were once our enemies." Flash and Twilight shared a glance, only for Magnus to scratch the back of his head, "Apologizes. It's just that things were very...different back in my day. I'm still getting used to not needing to worry about non-pony creatures."

"I understand." Flash responded, "I mean, your legends are all about fighting dragons and...we've fought plenty of monsters over the years. But, things are different now. These days, anything and anyone can be either a friend or an enemy."

"Yes," Magnus nodded, "The world has gotten quite complicated since I've been gone. I guess I'll run into more and more non-ponies here in Equestria."

As he said this, Spike ran in while holding a scroll. "Twilight! I just got a message from Princess Celestia!" The ponies turned to him as he ran over to Twilight's desk, the alicorn taking the scroll in her magic, only to scan it over and frown.

"Looks like there's been some criminals that have been causing problems in a small town up north." She turned to Flash, "She wants you to go deal with them."

Flash shined a big grin, "Got it." He did a small stretch, "Been a while since I've had any real action. Any idea how many I'm dealing with?"

"She's unsure, but believes there's only two."

"I can definitely handle that. Got the town's coordinates?"

"Yup. I'll get the Rune Gate set up while you get ready." The pair nodded at one another and turned to their guest, "Sorry Magnus. I'm afraid we'll have to wait a while before I can give you a proper tour of the school."

"It's fine," he replied, "This is important. If there are criminals causing problems for Equestria, then taking them down must always be your number one priority. It was no different as in my day."

"Thanks for understanding." Twilight said as they left the room, Flash Magnus watching them go.

"Yes...no different at all."

Flash quickly headed up to his room and grabbed his saddlebag, packing in a few essentials that he would need. Medical kit, portable food, rope and other supplies before grabbing his Celestic Gear. "Alright." He then went to the Rune Gate Room, Twilight already having the portal open. "I got everything I need."

"Good," Twilight replied, "I've sent the temporary Rune Gate to the village you're heading too. Once you've captured them, you can activate it and it'll send you straight to Canterlot where Celestia will have some guards waiting to take those criminals into custody."

Flash nodded and kissed her on the forehead, "Wish me luck."

"Don't you mean, wish us luck?" The pair turned to the voice and saw Flash Magnus, looking ready for a battle.

"Magnus?" Flash raised an eyebrow, "What are you doing here?"

"I've decided to assist you with your mission," Magnus stated as he took his shield off his back. The ancient relic shined in the room's light while Flash and Twilight shared a glance, "You said there was at least two criminals. If I go with you, it'll be even, and you'll have a better chance of bringing them to justice."

"I guess," Flash nodded. "But...are you sure you wanna do this? This isn't exactly a thousand years ago."

"Exactly," Magnus replied, "Compared to dragons, sirens and the pony of shadows, a pair of pony criminals won't stand a chance against me. And with your abilities, it'll be even less of a challenge." Flash and Twilight shared another glance, only for Magnus to add, "This is who I am, a warrior who faces off against villains. Who knows, maybe I'll impress Celestia and the other princesses enough that they'll make me a Royal Knight like you."

Flash turned to Twilight. "What do you think?"

Twilight shrugged back, "I don't see a problem. Like he said, he does have a lot of experience fighting against villains like this." She turned to Magnus, "Alright. Good luck you two."

"Thank you, your highness," Magnus bowed before turning to Flash. "Ready?"

"Uh...yeah." Flash nodded before turning to the portal, Magnus following him as they both passed through the pillar of light. In the blink of an eye, the pair were on the edge of a village that looked very similar to Ponyville. Quaint looking buildings, simple pathways and even a few rivers running through it. Mountains surrounded it, some looking like big hills while others were big enough to fit every house in Equestria in them.

"Nice place," Magnus commented, "But not very well defended by the looks of things. No wonder those criminals started causing problems here."

"Come on," Flash took out the scroll, "It says here that the mayor of the town is waiting for our arrival." They walked up to the place, only to see nopony out on the streets. Looking up at some of the buildings, they spotted ponies looking out the windows but jumping away as soon as they realized they were seen.

"This is just like in my day," Magnus commented, "The world was such a dangerous place...ponies feared to even step outside their homes." Magnus sighed, "I had hoped things would be different in the future."

"They are," Flash replied, "Nine times out of ten, the ponies of this town would be enjoying their lives without a care in the world. But then those that take joy in causing misery appear and try to ruin those lives. That's why the Royal Knights and tge Defenders of the Peace are here."

Magnus nodded, "I can understand that. That's how I tried to live my life, trying to protect those that can't protect themselves." As he said that, they turned onto a street and their eyes went wide. The place was completely destroyed, several houses burnt to a crisp while others looking like a gale force hurricane had blown them over.

"Whoa..." Flash whistled, "I'm willing to bet this is one of the reasons we were called here." They continued walking through the town, now finding more of it destroyed. It was a strange assortment of burns and knocked over items, making them wonder what kind of criminals they were up against.

And as they passed another blown over house, an earth pony appeared around a corner, "Excuse me!" He yelled as he ran up to them, "Are you Flash Sentry of the Royal Knights?!"

"I am," Flash nodded, "Are you the mayor?"

"No," he shook his head, "I'm his aide. We saw the light and hoped it was you, so he sent me to collect you and bring you to the hospital."

"Hospital?!" Magnus gasped as the earth pony turned to run off. The pegasi flew after him and the three made their way through the town until they reached a large building that looked just like the hospital in Ponyville, the earth pony leading them inside.

They soon arrived at a corridor where a brown middle-aged stallion was sitting. He was a unicorn with a white mane, tail and beard, wearing a bowler hat on his head along with a collar and tie around his neck. The stallion turned to them and looked hopeful, "Are you the Royal Knights that Princess Celestia promised to send?"

"I am," Flash responded, "Flash Sentry, Knight of Friendship. I've come to deal with these criminals that have been causing you problems."

"And I am Flash Magnus," the pillar of bravery added, "And I swear to you, we will bring these fiends to justice no matter where they are or what they intend to do."

"I...see," the mayor replied as he stared at Magnus with a raised eyebrow before looking back at Flash, "I'm happy you're here. These criminals have been causing a lot of damage and destruction. They appeared several days ago and held up a jewelry store. When the store owner tried to fight them off, one of the criminals blasted him backwards with a super loud sound that shattered the windows of every building in the street. Then they stole a bunch of food from the nearby supermarket and took all the cash from the machine. When the store clerks tried to stop them, they were suddenly zapped by something that set the place on fire."

"A super loud sound and getting zapped..." Flash whispered, "Huh. Why does that sound familiar?"

"Did you attempt to stop them?" Magnus asked, the mayor nodding.

"Yes. Every able bodied pony went after them. They chased them into the mountains, hoping their numbers could stop them. However..." He pushed the doors open and they all saw a room filled with beds, every one having an injured pony. Bandages and casts were everywhere, soon even mummified.

"By Hurricane's wing," Magnus gasped as he moved over to one of the beds. "Two ponies did all this?"

The mayor nodded, "They both have power a normal pony couldn't hope to stand up against." He turned to Flash, "That's why we contacted the princess for help. We expected a few royal guards, but having you here makes me hopeful this horrible event will soon end."

"Don't worry," Flash replied, "We'll make sure these two are taken down. Now, do you have any idea where they could be hiding out? I'd rather not wait here for them to show up and our fight makes things worse here."

"We have an idea. Follow me." The pair soon left the room, Magnus staying behind.

He walked up to one bed, seeing an earth pony stallion laying unconscious with bandages around his chest. Sitting beside the bed was a young blue pegasus with black hair. Looking at him, Magnus was reminded of a friend of his from back in his day. Nimbus Dash, though this pony was a colt. The young pegasus looked like he had been crying, as he stared over the other pony. "Child," the colt turned to him, "Is this your father?"

The colt sniffed as he used his wings to clean his eyes. "Yeah. He went after those bad ponies, but he was hurt really bad."

"I see." Magnus sighed as he around the room, "That appears to be the story of many a pony here."

"Why did those bad ponies come here?" He asked, "Nopony here ever did anything bad to anypony else? So why is something like this happening to us?"

Magnus often wondered that. Ever since he was a colt, it seemed that bad things tended to happen more to ponies that didn't deserve it then to those that did. "That's...just the way the world is sometimes." The colt continued to cry and held his father's hoof, Magnus frowning and placing a wing on his head. "Do not worry. I can see your father is strong. He will pull through, and I will make sure nopony ever harms him again."

With that, he turned and marched out of the room. In the hallway, he saw Flash and the mayor looking out the window before the defender turned to him and saw the fire in his eyes, "Alright," he told Magnus, "I've got a basic idea of where the criminals are. You ready?"

"Yes!" Magnus growled, "I'm ready to make those monsters pay. When I'm through with them, they'll regret ever coming here."

Flash flinched at those words, only for the mayor to point out the window, "As I was telling Mr. Sentry, the criminals were last seen on that mountain." Magnus looked out the window, "It's next to one of the only ways in and out of the village, meaning anypony that attempts to come here will be in danger of being attacked."

"Not when I'm done with them," Magnus pushed the window open and leapt out.

"Magnus!" Flash yelled as he flew after him, "Calm down! We need to come up with a plan first."

"The plan is simple: Find them, beat them, and make them pay for what they did."

"You're starting to scare me Magnus," Flash replied, "You're not gonna...do something extreme, are you?" Magnus turned to him, seeing him glare at the defender, "Listen, I don't know how things were done in your time. By making them pay, you don't mean killing them, do you?"

Magnus let out a growl, "If that's what it takes. Criminals need to be dealt with."

"That's not how we do things in this time period," Flash responded, "If there's no other way to stop them, if we have no choice but to do an absolute last resort...maybe we do that. But it is never the first thing you do."

"Then how do you expect us to stop them?"

"We capture them. Take them to Canterlot and have them stand trial. That's how we do things here in Equestria now." Magnus glared back at him, only to see Flash stare right back, fire also in his eyes. "I know you're angry, but that anger isn't gonna solve this."

Magnus let out a huff, "Fine. We'll find them and take them to Canterlot."

Flash nodded back before they began to fly after the mountain, the defender commenting, "That thing is pretty big. If they're hiding somewhere, it could take us a while the find 'em."

"Maybe we should split up," Magnus suggested.

"Not a good idea. We've got no way to contact each other if we find them. If we're gonna take them down together, we're gonna need to stick together." Magnus nodded and they began to fly over the mountain, searching every nook and cranny. And as they searched, they found the mountain had a water source that welled up from beneath the mountain, shooting up all the way through it and coming out the top like a volcano. The water spilled out over the edges, creating a series of streams that flowed down, one of them feeding into the village's rivers while also allowing the mountain to be covered in trees and foliage, allowing plenty of places to hide. And after an hour and a half of searching, the pegasi warriors found no sign of anypony living there. They would have kept searching, but the sun was beginning to set.

"We'll have to set up camp and continue in the morning," Magnus told Flash, the pegasus nodding before finding a spot in the trees that was flat and dry.

As soon as they landed, they got to work, Flash going to gather wood while Magus built a small pit to put the fire in. When he got back, they arranged the sticks and leaves, Magnus soon trying to get it lit. "Come on," he moaned as he rubbed the end of a stick against a block of wood and blew on it. He had been trying for ten minutes, only to get nothing. "Come on." He sighed and turned to Flash, "Wood must be damp or something."

"Sure," Flash nodded before reaching into his saddlebag, only for Magnus to hear a sound and turned to see Flash holding up a lit match that he threw into the pit. Within seconds, the flames began to spread and soon the fire was raging.

"That's cheating," Magnus grumbled, "As amazing as some of the innovations of this modern day are, I fear they are causing many of the great skills of my day to die out."

"Oh no, I know how to do that." Flash responded as he pointed at what Magnus had been doing. "And if I ever find myself in need of fire without any matches, I'll use it. This is just easier right now." Magnus nodded as he stared into the flames. As he did, Flash reached into his bag again and took out a few food rations. "Here!"

He threw a bag to Magnus, the pegasi seeing it was a rice pack. He watched as Flash stuck his to a long stick and held it over the fire, Magnus doing the same. "I'm impressed. You're clearly used to roughing it," he commented, "In my day, we would spend hours hunting for something to eat wherever we set up camp. Many nights we'd go hungry."

"Well, we're not gonna have much luck fighting these monsters if we're hungry," Flash responded, "Equestrian Military always keeps its soldiers well fed to make sure they don't make mistakes because of their hunger."

Magnus nodded, "Makes sense. Even so, you certainly are an interesting individual. After all, it's not everypony that wields such incredible power as you." He remembered seeing that power in action in their fight against the Pony of Shadows. "Say, how did you gain such power to begin with?"

Flash smirked as he pulled his bag away from the fire and ripped the top open. "It's a long story." He then told him the tale of his birth, how he was the last generation of ponies to be born with the genesis gene of the Original Alicorn. How that allowed Faust to imbue him with the Sacred Light, and the long process it took for him to learn how to access and control it. The battles he fought with it, and the dream he had that led him to the Lost City of Faust and his meeting with Shadow and Faust.

"Incredible," Magnus whispered, "Truly amazing. I thought the adventures me and my friends went on were unbelievable, but they don't hold a candle to yours." Flash chuckled at this. "It's strange." Magnus laid back and looked up at the stars. "When I was younger, I wanted to make something of myself. To help those around me and prove I was somepony that could be useful. I once told some of my legion-mates that in the future, every pony with the name Flash would have that name because their parents would idolize me and want their children to have the same amazing qualities I possessed."

Flash let out a laugh, "No wonder you and Rainbow Dash get along so well!"

Magnus shook his head at this, remembering the brave but egotistical pegasus he was talking about. "I suppose...though I guess the name Flash will always be synonymous with you now rather than me."

Flash went wide-eyed at this, "Are you kidding?! No way could I ever replace you as Equestria's greatest Flash!" Magnus raised an eyebrow at this, "And even if every pony named Flash gets that name because of me, they'll still have it because of you."

"What?"

"Your dream came true. My parents named me after you. My dad's always looked up to your legend, especially since..." He stopped and looked away.

"Since?" Flash remained silent for a moment.

"Since he believes he's descended from you." Magnus' eyes went wide at this, Flash blushing. "I mean...we don't know that for sure. But apparently, it's something that's been passed down in my dad's side of the family for a long time. That we can trace our family roots all the way back to the famous Flash Magnus."

"That's impossible," Magnus waved his hoof, "I never had any children."

"You sure? Did you have anypony special back before...you know, you were sucked into limbo?" When Flash said this, Magnus' face grew dim. "You did, didn't you?"

Magnus sighed and leaned back, "Yes. Her name was Sparkling Effervescence. She was an amazing mare. I saved her from a manticore and we grew close. I always hoped I would one day make a home with her...but then the Pony of Shadows appeared and threatened the realm, forcing Starswirl and the rest of us to sacrifice ourselves."

"Did you and Sparkling ever...you know." Magnus nodded, "Any particular time right before you disappeared?"

"The night before."

"Well then...maybe Sparkling was pregnant. Who knows? Maybe she named her child after you like my dad did. If I had a kid with somepony and that pony sacrificed their life to save the world, I'd want to give them that name and tell them who their mother was. And if the kid felt great pride in that name, he'd probably tell anypony that would listen that you were their parents."

Magnus blinked at this, only to feel a great sense of pride fill his heart. "Maybe...maybe you're right. Maybe you are my descendant."

"I hope so," Flash nodded, "And even if I'm not, holding your name is still a great honor. Now whenever somepony's named after me, they'll also be named after you. They'll have the honor of two great pegasi warriors backing them."

Magnus laughed at this, "That's certainly interesting." They both finished their meals and packed the empty bags away. Seeing nothing else to do and wanting to start their search early, they both laid down as Magnus took off his helmet. "If it is true, and you are my great great times a hundred grandson, I'm glad that my descendant has grown into an amazing knight. You make your family proud."

"Thanks." Flash responded before the pair felt themselves drift off.





The next day...

As soon as the sun was up, the two took to the air and began their search again. "They're out here somewhere," Magnus commented as they flew over to a river that splitting down the mountain. And as his eyes shifted around, he saw something fly out of a tree cluster, "Look out!" He yelled before flying over to Flash and holding up his shield, seconds before a bolt of lightning struck it. "Ahhh!" He flinched, the shield blocking most of it, but a few stray sparks managed to coil around and singe him.

"Where'd that come from?" Flash asked before looking down, "There they are!"

"Then let's get them!" Magnus roared.

"Wait!" Flash added as they both shot through the trees, landing in a clearing. The two went back to back as Flash took out his sword and Magnus held up his shield.

"Where'd they go?" Magnus growled.

"They're here somewhere," Flash continued, only to see a burst of light shine in front of him, making him hold up his sword, "There!" He blocked the bolt of lightning and then swung his weapon, "Flash Cutter!" The energy blade shot off the sword, hitting a tree trunk and causing it to explode.

"Hey!" A female voice yelped as she leapt out into the open to avoid getting crushed by the tree. "Watch where you swing that thing!" Flash saw it was a unicorn mare with a yellow coat and tail that had a cutie mark in the shape of a storm cloud with three lightning bolt rings around it.

"Electra?!" He yelped.

"A mare?" Magnus asked, turning to Flash. "And you know her?"

"Met her a few times," he hissed, "And if she's here, that means-" Before he could finish, a sound filled the air and grew louder, the defender soon spotting a wave of sound flying towards them, "COVER YOUR EARS!" Magnus did so and the pair braced themselves, the soundwaves slamming into them and pushing them back. And as the sound died down, a silver unicorn mare with a mane and tail that was a mix of black and white strips, her cutie mark being a window with glass shattering walked out into the open.

"Another friend of yours?" Magnus asked, his ears ringing a little as he and Flash lowered their hooves.

"Not a friend. Her name's Banshee."

"These two put all those ponies in the hospital?" Magnus asked, "How is that possible?"

"The same way your friends Meadowbrook, Mistmane and Somnambula are able to fight against powerful monsters like sirens and the Pony of Shadows. Or my friends."

Electra and Banshee glared at the defender, "Didn't expect to see you here Sentry. And who's your friend?"

"You might wanna tell him the renascence fair is two towns over," Banshee giggled before they both laughed.

"Jest while you can!" Magnus yelled, "But when this is over, we'll be the ones laughing."

He charged at this, his shield up and flying at Electra as her horn began to spark. She unleashed a bolt of lightning, but Magnus simply blocked it with ease, "Hey!" She cried as he got in close and threw a punch at her. "No fair!" She dodged the blow and leapt back, "What's that shield made of?"

"Ha!" Magnus cheered as he swung his leg around to try and kick her. "My shield is made of the ultimate magical bronze." Electra leapt back again. "It was designed to defend against fire, but it seems to protect against lightning just as well." He swung it next, trying to bash her in the head, but she rolled to the side and when she jumped to her hooves, her horn sparked and unleashed bolts of lightning that spread around her body. "That's new."

"Raaah!" She roared, flying at him while riding the lightning. Magnus leapt into the air, but was shocked to see Electra flying after him.

"Impossible!" He raised his shield just in time against an electrified punch, the blow pushing him back. "The skies...are a pegasi's domain!"

Electra laughed at this, "Shows what you know, grandpa!" She then zapped the shield again, "With the right spell, a unicorn can go anywhere." Magnus was soon pushed back, each block knocking him further as she continued to laugh.





Back on the ground, Flash and Banshee were locked in a long range battle. Flash kept firing Flash Cutters and Flash Forces, but Banshee dodged it all before screaming at him. Flash leapt behind a tree as the soundwaves slammed into it, ripping through the bark, but not touching the pegasus as he covered his ears.

"Earplugs," he whispered, "I've gotta add earplugs to my travel pack."

He then glanced around, only to smirk as he waited for Banshee to stop screaming. The defender dove for another tree next, Banshee firing another scream as the soundwaves slowly ripped through the wood. "You can't stay in there forever," Banshee told him once she stopped, "Just come out and have your eardrums shattered."

"You know," she heard the pegasus call out from behind the tree. "I met a bat-pony not too long ago. He was called Banshee too, and he also had your ability. And even though he was a kid, I'm willing to bet that he's way stronger than you."

"And what's your point?"

"No point. Just something I thought you'd like to know. And maybe hearing that you're not the best screaming banshee would shake your confidence enough." Banshee growled at this as he continued, "But honestly I was just trying to stop you from screaming for a minute or so." With that, Flash leapt out from behind the tree and charged as she unleashed her scream again. However, the attack struck Flash, but only slowed him down. To her shock, he didn't feel any pain in his ears and raised his sword, firing a laser she quickly leapt away from.

"How'd you do that?!" She glanced back at him, Flash smirking and shifting his head to the side just enough for her to see something green within his ears. "Moss?!"

"What?" Flash asked, holding his hoof to his ear. "What you say?"

"You made moss earplugs?!"

"Come again?" He asked, "Sorry, can't hear you. I made moss earplugs."

"Grrr...you little-"

"I can't hear you, so I'm just gonna get back to fighting! Flash Force!"





Electra panted as she fired bolt after bolt, Magnus easily blocking every blow. And as he charged at her, Electra shot to the side and spun to zap him again, but Magnus easily blocked it again. As she did this, she hissed as Magnus glared back at her, only to glance down and smirk.

"Perfect," she whispered before charging at him, Magnus raising his shield as Electra slammed her hooves into him, pushing him back a few inches, but nothing more. And as this happened, Electra shot around him in the blink of an eye.

He spun around, expecting another attack, only to see her flying back to the ground. "Hey! Get back here!" He yelled, diving down as Electra's lightning cloak vanished. "Out of magic, are we?" He watched she did her best to keep herself flying, pulling herself up moments before she almost crashed into the ground. She skimmed along the dirt until she reached one of the mountain streams, her magic cutting out as she fell into the water. She then laid there, the water not deep or strong enough to wash her away. Magnus landed on the edge and glared at her, the pegasus blinking at the sight before stepping into the water.

"It seems you're out of energy. That's what you get when you break the law and try to hurt the innocent," he told her, "I'm sure Flash has already defeated your friend. You'll soon be locked in a cell where you belong."

But as he said that, Electra's eyes shot open and suddenly shot up. Her horn unleashed more electricity than she had fired at Magnus, only to miss the pegasi completely...and struck the water under his hooves. The sight made Magnus say, "What are you-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!" He screamed as his entire body was shocked, causing him to drop his shield.

Electra laughed as she fell to the ground on the edge of the river, watching as Magnus shook in pain, only to flop over. "HA! Old fool. Don't you know water conducts electricity?!" Magnus barely heard her, his brain feeling like he had just drunk a hundred tankards of cider. "Later loser!" She covered herself in lightning and shot off, laughing all the way.





Banshee was leaping around, letting out every scream she could, only for Flash to brace through each blast of sound. With Flash's ears plugged, the unicorn had lost her best weapon against him, the defender getting closer to her with every attack. And as she dodged another blow, Flash spun around and slammed his backhooves into her chest, spit flying out of her mouth before getting thrown into a tree.

"It's over!" He yelled as Banshee started coughing. "Give up and you won't get hurt any more than you have too." Banshee glanced up to glare at him, only to cough again. Flash stared down at her, only for a bolt of lightning to strike the ground in front of him. "What?!"

"Surprise!" Electra laughed as she landed between him and Banshee.

Flash went wide-eyed at this, only to yank out his earplugs, "Where's Magnus?!"

Electra shined a big grin, "If you're talking about your friend, he's having a little nap in a nearby stream." She pointed behind herself, "Looks like you've got a choice. Arrest us and hope your friend doesn't roll over in his sleep and drown, or let us go and help him."

Flash's head shifted from behind her before glaring at her, only to flare his wings and fly off. "Sucker," Electra chuckled before turning to Banshee. "You okay?"

"Ugh..." Banshee moaned as she pushed herself up, "I will be."

"No time to rest though. We gotta get out of here before they come back."





Flash zoomed across the mountain, soon hearing a rushing river and flying up the stream. He then found a pony laying in the water, making him gasp, "Magnus!" He swooped down and scooped him up, putting him on the ground and taking off his helmet, patting his cheek. "Come on...wake up. Please!" He checked his pulse and he was alive, "Magnus!"

The pony let out a moan and his eyes flickered open, Magnus spitting out a drop of water, "Flash?" He sat up, moaning in response, "What happened? Did we win?"

"Not exactly," Flash rubbed the back of his head. "You kind of...lost."

"I lost?" Magnus asked, rubbing his head, "That's right. That mare...she blasted the water with her lightning. Somehow that caused me to get zapped. And she said something about...conducting? What does an orchestra have to do with this?"

Flash couldn't help but crack up at that, only to sigh, "Water conducts electricity. That means the lightning can travel through it and zap it."

"It does?" Magnus replied, Flash knowing that this pony from a thousand years in the past probably didn't know something that was common knowledge now, "Augh!" he groaned as he pushed himself up, "I can't believe I let something so pathetic happen to me." Magnus let out a long sigh, "Maybe I should have spent some of my past learning to control the weather with the other pegasi. I might have learned something like that."

Flash placed a hoof on his shoulder, "You can't be expected to know everything. You're still relatively new to this world, so of course you wouldn't know about certain things."

"Eh...maybe I'm too old fashioned. Back in my day, just one of those ponies who had that much power would have been a rarity...but this modern day has so many powerful ponies." He looked over to his fallen shield and picked it up, "Maybe this would do more good in the hooves of somepony else. Somepony that can actually stand hoof to hoof with powerful enemies like that."

"No way," Flash shook his head, "You might have lost this time, but that doesn't mean you can't beat them next time." He put a hoof on pillar's shoulder, "You're Flash Magnus. You fought off a bunch of fire breathing dragons."

"All I did was run while the others saved my friends. Back in my time, I could outthink my opponents, and when I couldn't, I had Starswirl or the others to help me. I got by on being smarter than my opponents, but if all the villains in this day and age as smart as that mare was...I don't stand a chance."

"Well...you're right," Flash responded, "Criminals are always getting smarter and stronger." Magnus frowned at this, "But so do the heroes. Just because Electra outsmarted you once doesn't mean you can't outsmart her next time. You just have to play to your strengths and keep an eye out for any more of her tricks."

"If I can," Magnus sighed. "But I'm a thousand years behind. There's no way I can learn everything my enemies will know. What's that saying you have in this time? You can't teach an old dog new tricks?"

Flash chuckled at this, "Except you can. You just using that phrase proves it. The world might be a thousand years more advanced, but it's still the same world in the most important parts. The good guys, us, always bring the baddies down." He spread his wings. "I can't do this without you. I need you. That town needs you. So, what's it gonna be? Are you just gonna give up, or are you gonna prove why you were a legendary hero and keep trying?"

Magnus stared at him, then down at his shield. He looked at his reflection in it before nodding. "You're right. No matter what time I'm in, there are ponies that need my help." He grabbed his helmet and put it back on, "Let's do this!" Flash smirked as Magnus spread his wings and the two high-winged before taking to the sky.





Electra and Banshee continued to run down the mountain. "Hurry up!" The electric unicorn yelled to the screamer, "We gotta get out of here!"

"I know," Banshee replied, "But you said you fried the other pony. Sentry's not gonna just leave him behind. He'll take him to hospital, and that'll give us plenty of time to get away." But as she said that, a bright light filled the air above them. The mares quickly leapt to the side, seconds before a Flash Force hit the dirt, an explosion coming next.

They both looked up and saw the two pegasi flying down, Flash's sword smoking from the attack he had just unleashed. Electra turned to Banshee, "You were saying?"

Banshee growled at her, "You're the one that blasted him! If you used a little more power, he wouldn't be up and flying at us!"

"I hit him with enough juice to overload every building in Manehatten!" Electra hissed, "There's no way he should be up and flying."

"It'll take more than a little lightning to stop me," Magnus yelled as the ponies landed in front of them. "Now, if you ladies down mind, we've got a nice cell we're sure you're going to love."

"Yeah," Flash nodded, "You'll love it so much that you'll want to stay...for fifteen to twenty years." The mares growled and Electra sparked up, Banshee taking a deep breath. Flash and Magnus braced themselves as she used her magic and unleashed her super sonic scream.

The attack washed over the pair, pushing them back a few inches, but doing nothing to their ears. Banshee stopped at this, going wide-eyed as Magnus chuckled and turned to Flash. "These moss earplugs work like a charm!" Flash couldn't hear what he said, but he nodded back before turning their attention back on the two criminals.

They both charged, weapons at the ready. Banshee leapt back as Electra and started unleashing a bunch of electrical attacks, Flash and Magnus both using their weapons to block. Flash swiped at her, but the unicorn cloaked herself in lightning and once again took to the air, Magnus leaping after her.

The screaming unicorn unleashed a beam from her horn, Flash then deflecting it before leaping into the air. "Flash Grinder!" He spun and morphed into a wheel of light, slamming into Banshee instantly.

"Augh!" She cried as she was knocked back, the wheel pinning her between itself and a tree. She hissed in pain as the light burned her side, but she then took a breath and screamed.

The soundwaves sent the wheel flying back, Flash breaking out of it as he did this. "Flash Cutter Barrage!" He roared, unleashing multiple blades of light as Banshee tried to run away. But as she did this, Flash pushed his hooves on a tree and leapt off. Banshee then screamed again as Flash fired another Flash Cutter, the two attacks colliding with the energy blade exploding. Banshee quickly got a face full of smoke, which she accidently inhaled. This resulted in a large coughing fit for her, preventing the mare from screaming.

Flying down, he quickly grabbed her tail, "Hey!" She yelped as Flash flew her right up before spinning around, the mare spinning like a pinwheel before he released her with a flick of the hoof. She screamed as she fell into the dirt, crashing and losing consciousness instantly. Flash sighed in relief as he flew down and checked on her, not finding any broken bones. She was breathing, so he had completed his task.





Meanwhile...

Magnus spun through the air, dodging a barrage of bolts. But as he tried to get close, she would unleash a sphere of lightning that zapped anything within a hundred feet of her. Magnus sighed as he flew back, panting from his previous injuries.

"I gotta find a way to pull her blug." He wasn't sure he was saying that right, but he didn't care. Then, he heard a sound and looked past her before smiling. "Time for a spot of revenge." He charged at this, Electra firing several bolts as he thrust his shield, blocking through them. He then shoved his shield at her, Electra spinning around him to zap him, but Magnus followed her and blocked it as well. The pegasi flew down at this, blocking another bolt as he kept going lower.

It was here taht Magnus flew down to another river, this one higher off the ground. A series of large rocks piled together and bound by mud and other things formed a natural aqueduct, which the water was rolling down at tremendous speed. Magnus flew down at this stream, panting as he yelled at Electra. "Come on! Come and get me!" He raised is shield, ready to defend himself. Electra's body kept sparking with lightning as she dived, letting out a mighty roar as she prepared to body slam Magnus. "That's it," he quietly told her. "Just focus on me." He waited and waited as she got closer and picked up speed. Then, when she was moments away from slamming into him, he leapt out of the way. "GOTCHA!"

Electra watched as the stallion leapt out of the way, allowing her to see what was behind him. Her eyes went wide and she tried to stop, Magnus rolling to a stop as he expected to hear a splashing fill the air...only to hear nothing. "Huh?" He turned to see Electra flying above the river, laughing.

"How stupid do you think I am?" She asked while flying down and landed on the ground between him and the river. "You really think I didn't notice that river? Please. I knew what you were doing the whole time. You can't trick a trickster."

Magnus growled and readied his shield as Electra's body sparked with lightning. "Now, it's time to put you down for good!" She built up as much power as she could before letting it rip, the electrical blast flying at Magnus.

"Gotcha." He then positioned his shield, the lightning bouncing off it and back toward Electra, only to bend upward and slam into the rock pile. Electra gasped when she heard the rocks explode, blowing a large hole in the side of the aqueduct...which shot out a blast of water right at her.

The unicorn gasped at the sight, the water slamming into her. She screamed in pain as her lightning zapped her, Magnus leaping upward as this happened. He watched as Electra was swept away, then flew over to the aqueduct and slammed into it. Some of the rocks above the hole fell down at this, blocking it up and cutting the water. The flowing died down and Electra surfaced as the water washed away, the electric mare laid out on the ground while still sparking.

Magnus flew down, being careful not to touch the wet grass before looking Electra over as she began to moan and move. "Don't you know water conducts electricity?" he told her before raising his shield and slamming it down on her head just hard enough to knock her out.

Electra cried out as she fell into unconsciousness, Magnus sighing as he tried to think of a way to contain her so he could go back and help Flash. That is, till Flash suddenly appeared above the trees and flew down him with a tied-up Banshee on his back. "You okay?"

"I'm fine," Magnus replied, "Don't touch the grass yet." Flash nodded as Magnus turned to see a knocked out Banshee, "Managed to defeat her, I see."

"Yup," Flash nodded, "So did you."

Magnus sighed again, "Yes. But it was a close one though. If my aim had been even an inch or so off, I would probably be overly crispy right now." Flash smiled at this and put Banshee down, taking out another length of rope.

"Come on. Let's get these two tied up before they come around and return to town. I'm sure the mayor will be happy to hear he doesn't have to worry about them anymore. At least until the next group of criminals decide to use this place as their stomping grounds."

"Yes," Magnus nodded with a long frown, "That could be a problem."





With their targets caught and contained, the pair returned to the village. The mayor and its citizens were all happy to hear the two criminals had been apprehended, all cheering when Flash and Magnus paraded the mares down the street toward the spot Twilight had placed the rune gates. Both mares were now wearing anti-magic horn rings and had their hooves chained, making it impossible for them to escape or fight back. All they could do was see the glares of anger coming from the ponies they terrified.

"Oh, thank you," the mayor told them both. "You've saved my citizens from living a life of terror. With these two behind bars, the town can get back to normal."

"No problem sir," Flash replied, "I'm happy to help." He looked around the quaint little town, which continued to remind him of Ponyville. "This place in a nice quiet town, but that can also work against you." The mayor raised an eyebrow at this, "Electra and Banshee chose this place because they knew there was nopony here to fight back. And they might not be the last ones to do that. You might wanna look into upping your security around here, at least a little bit."

"I guess you're right," the mayor sighed, "I don't suppose I could convince you to stay, could I Mr. Sentry?"

"Afraid not," Flash responded, "I have too many responsibilities back in Ponyville." The ponies all sighed at this, Magnus staring at all the fillies, colts, mares and stallions that made up the population. The ancient warrior knew the likelihood of the town needing to be saved again were low, but still it was better safe than sorry. That is, till an idea formed in his head.

They all continued through the town until they reached the Rune Gate, the townsponies watching in amazement when Flash activated the device. Electra and Banshee were forced to step inside, where an army of armed guards were waiting to put them into holding cell to await trial.

Flash then turned to Magnus, "Ready to go? I bet you'll be excited to see Canterlot again. Maybe we can drop by the guard's training ground, and you can show them how the legion did it in the old days."

Magnus chuckled at this, but then shook his head. "Sorry Flash, but...I don't think I'll be coming with you."

"What?"

Magnus looked back at the town, Flash doing the same. "This town needs somepony to protect it, and I don't have any place to call home. So...maybe I can make a home for myself here."

"You...wanna stay?"

"Why not?" Magnus asked, turning back at him. "You said it yourself that the town needed better security. I might be out of touch with modern times, but I can still protect this town when it needs it." He glanced over at the mayor, "If you'll have me."

The mayor smiled and nodded, "We would be honored." The rest of the townsponies cheered at this, Magnus smiling before turning to Flash.

"Well...I guess this is it."

"Yeah," Flash nodded, "I guess it is." He held up a hoof, Magnus taking it before the pair shook. "Good luck. I hope you enjoy yourself here, Mr. Defender of the Peace." Magnus let out a laugh before the pair split apart and Flash stepped into the portal, waving back at him with his wing. And when he was gone, the portal deactivated, and Magnus was left with his new duties. It was a whole new beginning for him.





The next day...

Twilight was in her office at school, filling out some papers when the alarm she had placed in her office that signaled the Rune Gate's activating went off. She quickly teleported to the room and smiled at the sight of somepony step out of the portal.

"Flash!" She ran over and hugged him, Flash embracing her back. "How'd things go? Did you manage to capture the criminals?"

"Yup. And they're already being shipped off for hopefully the last time." Twilight blinked at his comment, only to notice he was alone.

"What happened to Magnus?"

"Don't worry about him." he chuckled, "He's where he needs to be."





As Magnus flew above the town, he felt something he had never felt before. Not with his parents, or with the legion, or even with the other pillars. Contentment. Like he could live the rest of his life in the small and never be sick of it. He landed atop one of the houses and turned to a building currently being reconstructed. And as some of the ponies were lifting a large beam using a pulley, one of the lines snapped and the beam began to fall, the ponies screaming at the sight.

But as it began to fall on a pony, Magnus swooped in and scooped her up before the beam crashed into the ground. The ponies cheered at their new hero as Magnus lowered the mare to the ground before taking flight again. He then landed on the roof of another house and smiled, spotting a bunch of young ponies playing in the streets. This included the colt he had met at the hospital, who was a lot happier now that his father was awake and recovering.

The colt saw Magnus and smiled, his eyes glowing with admiration. Magnus grinned back, happy he could make the ponies feel safe again. It just goes to show that as long as you love doing what you do, there'll always be a place for you in the world. A new line of heroes now existed within Equestria, starting with the legendary Pillar of Bravery, and carrying on to those he inspires. The chain that would go on for generations.

	Dear Twilight,

As you probably already know by now, I broke my wing. Again.


Rainbow Dash grinned, looking up at her doctor from her position on the gurney. “So, Doctor Stable, do I at least get an ‘A’ for radicalness?” she asked with wide eyes as she smiled up at him sheepishly. She was moving down to another hospital wing with Doctor Stable and two orderlies in tow, pushing her gurney along as they went.

Stable shot Rainbow a glance as they continued walking. “First of all, Miss Dash, radicalness—if that is even a word at all—starts with an ‘R’, not  an ‘A’,” he criticized, fixing his gaze down to consider his chart further. “Secondly, you’ve managed yourself a Grade-B closed fracture. If you keep this up the way you’re going, you can forget another week here; soon enough you won’t be able to fly at all.”

“There’s no ‘A’ in ‘effort’ either,” Rainbow challenged, smirking. “But everyone’s okay with saying that.”

“We aren’t here to argue about proverbs, you know,” Stable pointed out. “I worry about you sometimes. You’re going to really hurt yourself one of these days, and there won’t be anything I can do to save you.”

“I’ll be alright, Doc,” Rainbow whispered, looking up at the moving ceiling as she rested her head back against the pillow. “I’ll be alright.”

For a while they carried on, the orderlies occasionally stopping to utter a half-hearted apology to somepony in their way as they took wide turns around the corners in the hospital. Rainbow Dash took note of every wing she passed: coronary unit, neurological, geriatric, maternity. The hospital was truly bigger on the inside than it was on the outside. With so many staff members and patients, Rainbow couldn’t help but wonder if the entire town was inside here waiting. It seemed almost surreal that this many ponies even lived in Ponyville, let alone be sick. It made her shiver, but only a little. Although it was only to calm herself, she settled on the rationalization that Ponyville General took in more patients from around Equestria than just where she lived. That made enough sense. Right?

The walk seemed to stretch on for hours, and Rainbow was getting more anxious by the minute. The hairs of her coat stood on end as she shuffled under her blankets, unable to find a comfortable position. Her eyes darted around, looking back and forth between bedrooms and odd-looking machines that were being operated silently by ponies in dark green scrubs. She glanced at every medical device there was; however, she never took the time to grasp what she was actually looking at before trying to fixate on something else. Frustrated, she closed her eyes and counted to herself. It wasn’t of much help.

Noticing her behavior, Doctor Stable placed a hoof on Rainbow’s shoulder. The contact alone calmed her, and she managed to take her mind off of the fact that she had been sweating for the past few minutes. “Rainbow Dash, I’m going to give you something to help you relax. Is that alright?”

No, it wasn’t alright. Rainbow Danger Dash was the strongest, coolest, most mentally-stable pony you’d ever meet. There was no way she was going to accept anything to make herself feel better, she was already at one hundred ten percent. Nothing made Rainbow Dash nervous, not even this. Not even hospitals. She could deal with anything on her own. There wasn’t any possibility of her agreeing. Awesome ponies aren’t scared of anything. Awesome ponies are completely chill. Awesome ponies don’t need drugs.

Rainbow nodded weakly. “Y-yeah, that would be cool, I guess...” she said softly. “Thanks.”


I guess I got banged up pretty bad this time, because they want to keep me in here for a while. I hope you and the girls come visit soon. That would be awesome.

Okay, I don’t really know why I’m writing you this. I just... I just trust you a little bit more than myself here. I think Princess Celestia would really like to hear what I have to say, but I don’t know how to write it to her myself, and I was hoping you could turn this into some kind of friendship report to her or whatever. It’s kind of lame, I know. I don’t get it either. I could just write it to the princess, but for some reason I really wanted you to hear it first. I’m sorry. 

I swear Twilight, If you tell Applejack I said any of this, I’m going to punch you so hard your horn falls off.


Rainbow Dash tensed up as the syringe shot into her aching deltoid, announcing its presence as the needle cut through her expertly. Then, almost immediately after the medicine was released, every muscle in Rainbow Dash’s body all relaxed at once. She released a breath she had been holding, letting go a blissful sigh of relief.

“That’s good stuff, Doc,” Rainbow Dash said, smiling up at Stable. “I bet you charge tons for that.”

“On the topic of your insurance, Miss Dash,” Stable began, flipping his chart to a more relevant page. “You do understand that there cannot be any more of the displays we had last time, correct? No more barging into my office asking me to check the progress of a wing you didn’t break,” he said with a smirk. “It took me forever to explain to them how those fees were legitimate.” 

Rainbow Dash laughed a little, drawing upon the memories of her first time here. “No funny business this time,” she said lightly. “I promise.”

Rainbow Dash, Doctor Stable, and the orderlies were met with a large, locked door as they came to the end of the hallway they were in. Stable stepped in front of the group, focusing his attention on a small black box on the door. Lighting up his horn with green energy, he magically pressed a seemingly random combination of buttons. A green light lit up on the box as he finished, signaling that he had entered the right code. A few seconds later, the doors slowly crept open by themselves, revealing them to the wing that stood before them.

It was absolutely dreadful.

Every room was made of glass sliding doors and thinly veiled curtains to give patients what the hospital claimed was adequate privacy. The floor was lined with red caution tape on either side of the hall that read: ‘must wear gowns from this point on’. The entire wing was a sickly silver, like the whole building was made of sterilized stainless steel. Inside each room was nearly a laboratory full of different machines and monitors, all of which were hooked up to the central nurses' station. All of which Rainbow Dash didn’t know the meaning of.

“Uhm...” Rainbow Dash began, trailing off as she looked around the wing. All of the patients were either asleep or hacking away in misery as they watched somepony on television lose at whatever game show was playing. It was morbid at best, making Rainbow consider whether or not she should have asked for a higher dose of sedative. “What is... is this where I...?”

“As I said, Rainbow Dash, your injuries are very severe,” Stable said, looking Rainbow in her worried eyes. “This is the progressive care unit, or ‘P.C.U’. It’s where ponies go if they need to be constantly monitored but aren’t sick enough to be in intensive care. Since the X-Rays haven’t been giving us a clear picture of what’s going on inside your wing, we have to assume that it is in a volatile state until we can open you up to take a look.”

“O-open me up?” Rainbow stuttered.

“From what I can tell right now, Surgery is our best option,” Stable explained, trying his best to keep his tone distant and factual. “The fuzzy pictures we’ve been getting may indicate that the bones in your wing have shattered. Can you tell me again how you got those injuries?”

“Well,” she began, taking a moment to draw on her thoughts. “I was up at Winsome Falls doing some aerobic exercises yesterday morning. I was just gliding along regularly, then all of a sudden, bam! My right shoulder cramps up.” Rainbow said, making an overdramatized jerking motion with her shoulder. “So while I’m dealing with that, I don’t even notice that I’ve stopped flapping my right wing. Now I’m in a corkscrew going down at just a perfect angle that I get caught in the downstream of one of the waterfalls. You have those two colts, right? I’m sure you’ve been camping up at Winsome Falls. I’m sure you’ve seen the rocks at the bottom. You can tell how this story ends.”

“Yes I have, and that I can,” Stable agreed, sighing as he turned to another page in Rainbow Dash’s chart. “Ninety of morphine upon admission, another eighty this morning, and six of fospropofol disodium just now. Rainbow Dash, this jetset life is going to kill you,” he concluded.

“So could surgery,” she muttered under her breath, breaking eye contact with her doctor.

Doctor Stable smirked a little, nudging Rainbow Dash on the side. “Now don’t be like that,” he said. “Doctor Steady Hooves is the single greatest neurosurgeon in all of Equestria. World famous, I tell you. Rumor has it she even operated on one of the Wonderbolts after a training accident.”

“The Wonderbolts?!” Rainbow squeaked out, her face lighting up in excitement. She turned back to Stable, grabbing him on the foreleg desperately. “Which one was it? Were they injured bad? Did the press cover the story? Did they have to retire after the accident? Did the operation work? Did she kill a Wonderbolt?” Rainbow barraged, assaulting the poor doctor with question after question.

Then it hit her.

“Doc...” Rainbow began, her enthusiasm draining as she looked up at Stable with a concerned expression. “What kind of surgeon did you say she was?”

“A neurosurgeon,” he answered matter-of-factly.

“If all I have is a broken wing, then why do I need a neurosurgeon?” Rainbow asked, bracing herself for the worst news. 

Doctor Stable sighed, stopping the orderlies from continuing on. “Rainbow Dash, if you shattered your wing the way I think you did, then it is very possible that you have damaged many of your finer, peripheral nerve endings in the wing. While you would still be able to move it after a routine orthopaedic procedure, we want to give you the best chance of getting back to your old self. That requires having someone perform the surgery who knows how to fix any damaged nerve endings should they be discovered.”

Rainbow Dash deflated, sinking into her bed. “So you’re telling me there’s a chance that I’ll never fly again?”

Stable considered himself for a moment. “I don’t believe the odds of that particular outcome are high; however...” he trailed off. “If you need to talk to anyone at all, the hospital staffs an excellent psychiatric team.”

Rainbow Dash simply stared at him.

“Hey, Doctor Stable?” she said after a moment of thought. “Is there any way I could have a bit more of that floppy discoball stuff you gave me earlier?”


I’m not gonna lie. I was pretty scared. I still am now, but I’ll get over it. Doctor Steady Hooves told me that there’s no room for fear in the O.R., so I’ll get it out of me. Hehe, must be weird to hear me of all pegasuses say that, right? Hospitals kinda freak me out. So does all of this. I mean, death-defying stunts I can handle no problem. This? This is all really weird.

No sweat for the most awesomazing pegasus in all of Equestria, though. I have a feeling in my gut, Twi’, I’m going to kick some serious surgery flank! It’ll be so easy that I could do it in my sleep!

Get it? Because I’m... oh, whatever.

When Doctor Stable told me that my flying might be in trouble, I was kinda bummed out. Well, no, that’s kinda downplaying it a bit. I was really, really upset. I wish you had been there. I never took up on his offer to see a shrink though. That’s for crazy, depressed ponies. I’m way too cool for any of that stuff.

Besides, I kind of... got a little sidetracked.


“Here’s our stop,” announced Stable, reaching out his hoof to slide the door open. As they made their way in, Rainbow Dash was surprised to discover that she wasn’t the only occupant. The room was laid out so that two opposing beds lay facing each other, only separated by an optional privacy curtain which was currently drawn back, leaving nothing between the two beds. In the bed closest to the door sat a young, dark blue pegasus colt with a mixed mane of both bright and dull shades of yellow. He was ignoring the entering ponies, instead keeping his eyes focused on the book he was reading, studying it intently. In one of his forelegs was an IV line that lead to a bag of clear fluids that was marked with symbols that Rainbow couldn’t read.

The orderlies moved Rainbow Dash from the gurney to her hospital bed where a nurse was waiting to start an IV for her. She had assured Rainbow that it was “only the morphine drip that Doctor Stable had ordered,” but that didn’t mean Rainbow wasn’t going to check with the big boss. She turned to her doctor, who only smiled and nodded. Rainbow then relaxed, letting the nurse do her work on her while the orderlies made sure she was comfortable in her new bed. Satisfied, Rainbow thanked the hospital staff and allowed them to get back to their other patients.

That left her and the colt.

It was an odd sight for Rainbow. He just sat there reading silently. At first, she didn’t understand it. Most kids his age would be at least playing video games or something if they were in his situation, right? That totally wasn’t what she herself did whenever she had any downtime. No sir-ee, but a colt might be into that kind of stuff.

All in all, she didn’t know what to expect. Here she was, going through what may have been the single most stressful day of her life alone, and to top it all off she now had to share a room with a most-likely depressed child. That didn’t fly too well with Rainbow. First of all, she didn’t know the first thing about how to interact with kids as an adult herself. Sure, she had friends when she was little, but it was different now. Now she had to be a positive influence, a role model, a friend, and a confidant all in one for every child she met. It was part of the job of being a grown-up, and in this case, she wasn’t looking forward to it, not one bit.

Though, she did have to admit, he looked pretty sweet. A lonely colt wrapped in blankets reading to himself made Rainbow’s long-dormant maternal instincts kick in. Although she would never admit it, just looking at him made her want to go over there and give him a hug. A colt in need with no parents in sight. No matter how awesome or cool Rainbow Dash was, this was something that could hit a pony hard. No kid should have to experience being in a place like this, especially not all by themselves. His sad, apathetic eyes nearly made her heart break right then an—

“You gay or somethin’?” the colt asked.

Rainbow did a double take. “W-what?” she asked, stuttering with her reply.

“I asked, are you gay or something,” he repeated, slowly drawing out the statement to make sure Rainbow heard every word of it clearly. His voice cracked due to his age, producing a somewhat rough but higher pitched voice that strikingly resembled Rainbow’s own. The colt, who had now put his book down, was staring at Rainbow impatiently with a cocked eyebrow as he tapped his hoof on the bed frame.

“What makes you think that?” Rainbow Dash retorted, putting more than a little bit of ice into the last word.

The colt shrugged her response off and pointed at her. “You dyed your mane rainbow. What’s everypony supposed to think?”

Rainbow Dash took some of her own mane in her hoof and stared at it for a few moments. “That’s not what it means,” she finally said, releasing her hair. “I was born with this mane. As a matter of fact, my dad had the same kind. It runs in the family.”

The colt smirked. “Which dad?” he asked.

“Oh you little—”


He wasn’t really at all what I would have expected. It’s not the image those charity commercials give you of sick kids in hospitals, but I guess you don’t really know until you meet one. I just happened to get the most annoying one of all.

That reminds me, would you mind checking up on Squirt? Erm, I mean, Scootaloo. She probably doesn’t know why I haven’t been around town the past couple days. Let her know that the most rad pony ever got into a fight with nature and won. I’m just working out the terms of engagement for our rematch is all.

I’m not sure I want her visiting just yet, though. She kind of... looks up to me, you know? I don’t want her to see me like this. She needs to know me as the awesome Rainbow Dash, the greatest flier in Equestria, sole pony to ever perform the legendary sonic rainboom. She shouldn’t see Rainbow Dash, patient fifty-two with the beat up wing. Would hurt her too much, you know? And uh... it would hurt me a little too.

I’m not doing so well, Twi’.


After their altercation, Rainbow Dash had left the colt well enough alone. She had little patience to be in an argument over what ponies she liked with a kid who probably didn’t even think of fillies like that yet anyways. However, on a list of Rainbow Dash’s troubles, the colt’s comments didn’t even make the first book. He was just a colt after all, and there wasn’t any reason Rainbow should hold his curiosity against him.

“Hey, kid, what’s your name?” Rainbow Dash asked, trying her best to crack the colt a smile.

“Your,” he replied, looking up from his book for the second time that day. “My name’s Your.”

“Your? What kind of a name is Your?” Rainbow Dash asked, uncaring of how that may have come across.

“Your as in Your Mom,” he replied. Rainbow facehoofed.

“Seriously, what’s your name? I wanna know,” Rainbow insisted. To her surprise, the colt simply sighed and put his book down. He looked out of the window momentarily, thinking to himself. Rainbow didn’t really know how to take in the sight. She had known this kid for the better part of two hours and she already found that he was full of surprises at every turn.

“What are you in for?” he asked, still staring out of the window.

“Broken wing,” she said. “You?”

“Headaches,” he replied, turning back to Rainbow Dash. “My name’s Lightning, by the way. I already know yours, though. The doctor called you Rainbow something when you came in.”

“Dash,” she completed for him with a small smile. “My name is Rainbow Dash.”

“It’s nice to meet you, Rainbow Da—”

With a gust of air that blew Lightning’s mane off to the side, the door to their room swung open to reveal a blonde-coated pegasus mare with a straight, silky brunette mane in a white lab coat sitting in a rolling doctor’s stool. Whistling loudly and terribly, the mare pushed off with her wings, sending her sliding off in Rainbow Dash’s general direction. She spun around in her stool a few times before standing up and kicking it aside suddenly, revealing her cutie mark: a blue scepter with outstretched wings. Around the base of the scepter were two snakes, coiling up until they reached a point just under the wings. Above the entire symbol was a bright pink brain, resting in the central area between both wings.

“Well lookie what I’ve got here,” the mare said, grinning as she looked back and forth between Rainbow and Lightning. Her voice was clear and feminine, carrying just an edge of childlike excitement. “My two favourite patients in the same room? What are the odds! It must be my lucky day.”

While Lightning laughed a knowing laugh, Rainbow looked at the new pony incredulously. “Favourite patients?” she asked, cocking her head sideways. “But I’ve never met you before.”

The mare’s smile only grew wider. “Oh, well we can’t have that, can we?” she asked, stepping over to Rainbow’s bedside and causing the other mare to tense up slightly. “I’m Doctor Steady Hooves, practicing neurosurgeon and amateur skateboarding enthusiast,” she said, halting her monologue to flick at Rainbow’s mane with her hoof. “And I’m guessing by that colorful noggin you got over there, you must be Rainbow Dash.”

“How long it take you to figure that one out, Doctor Steads?” Lighting chirped from across the room.

Steady Hooves laughed blissfully, filling the room with her positive energy. She leaned in close to Rainbow Dash, putting a hoof in front of her ear. “Be careful with that one,” she said in a loud, exaggerated whisper. “One minute he’s your best friend, then bam! He steals your stethoscope right out from under you. Uses it to try and get into the doctor’s lounge. You can call me Steads, by the way.”

“One time!” Lightning said, now on the verge of crying from laughter.

Rainbow Dash couldn’t help but give in to Steads’ infectious smile. Her presence alone and the mood she brought with her was already making Rainbow feel a lot better than she had been feeling just a couple minutes ago. She found herself looking into Steads’ deep brown eyes, their soft and fun expression matching the playful smile on her face. Her mane, which looked smooth enough to swim in, fell down past her shoulders and onto the side of Rainbow Dash’s bed. It was then that Rainbow noticed that Steads smelled a bit like cinnamon. Rainbow liked cinnamon. A lot. It was safe to say that Rainbow Dash wasn’t all that nervous around Steads anymore.

That, and Rainbow was staring at her.

It was safe to say that Rainbow Dash was nervous around Steads again.

Rainbow darted her face away from Steads, blushing lightly. Much to her further embarrassment, she saw Lightning reviewing the scene skeptically from his own side of the room; an occurrence that only made her blush even harder.

Oblivious, Steads smiled softly and placed a hoof on Rainbow’s shoulder. This time when she spoke, it was a much quieter, more caring tone. “Rainbow, if it’s alright with you, I’d like to check the wing you hurt to make sure all of your nerves are working properly. Would that be okay?”

Rainbow retracted a little from Steads’ touch. “Is it... going to hurt?” she asked. She had never felt more powerless in her life. She had never felt so un-Rainbow Dash before. She didn’t like it one bit.

Steads reaffirmed her touch, stroking Rainbow’s coat gently. “I promise it won’t hurt a bit.”

“Okay then,” Rainbow said. Steads reassurance brought up Rainbow’s much-dwindled confidence. She didn’t need any further explanation or proof. She trusted this pony who she had only known for a few minutes. It was weird. It was as if Steads was making her feel... safe, almost.

Steads carefully helped Rainbow lift herself into a sitting position on the bed before propping open her bad wing. Rainbow shivered as she extended the appendage, feeling every loose bone twist and turn. If she hadn’t been sky high on morphine at that moment, she would have been saying some words that would have made the hospital relocate Lightning into another room for the rest of his time there.

As Steads’ hoof began to draw closer to Rainbow Dash, she spoke up. “Look, Doctor Steads,” she began, her body quivering in nervousness and unknowing anticipation. “I know you said you had it under control and all but I’m having second thoughts about this and ohmygoshyourhoovesaresowarm—”

Rainbow practically melted as Steads' expert hooves kneaded into the base of her wing, eliciting sharp squeaks for every feather she touched. Rainbow Dash was in heaven, and the blush on her cheeks made that obvious. She had no idea how she looked to Steads at that moment, but she knew that Steads must have been a true professional, because any comment she had she managed to keep to herself. The same couldn’t be said for Lightning, who was now on his back laughing at the display in front of him.

Rainbow Dash shot him a hard glare, growling as she looked on at him. “Listen here you little twerp, when I’m done here I’m going to come over and—”

“Rainbow Dash, can you tell me if you are feeling this?” interrupted Steads, her voice full of concern.

Rainbow snapped out of her moment. “Feeling what?” she asked, only to look back and see Steads fidgeting with an unresponsive feather. Rainbow’s heart sank immediately, her eyes becoming the size of pebbles. “No, no no no!” she exclaimed, wrenching her wing back. The sudden strain on her injuries flooded Rainbow with a surreal, electric pain. She screamed, causing both other ponies in the room to jump back.

“Rainbow Dash, calm down!” Doctor Steads said, pushing Rainbow back down onto her bed as she writhed in agony. “Listen to me! This is normal, alright? Everything is okay. You’re going to be okay. It’s only one of your secondaries, you lose them when you molt, remember? It's not one of the pinion feathers you grow when you start to fly as a filly.”

Rainbow breathed in hard, her chest pushing up against Steads’ hoof. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“It’s okay, Rainbow Dash,” Steads said, hopping up to sit on Rainbow’s bedside. “Everything is going to be fine. I’m going to order you a bit more of that nice stuff that Doctor Stable gave you to calm you down, alright?” Rainbow nodded vigorously. “All of your primary feathers responded perfectly to the physical. I will get you in the air again, don’t you worry. Okay?”

“Okay,” Rainbow said, letting a small, hesitant smile form on her features.

“I’ll be in to check up on you later tonight, okay?” Steads said, picking up Rainbow’s chart. She turned to one of the back pages, scribbling down a few paragraphs before looking back up to see Rainbow’s expectant face. “Everything is going to be alright, believe you me. Don’t you doubt that for a second. Doctor Lightning will make sure of it too, so long as he isn’t too busy trying to get into the staff snack cupboard, won’t you, Doctor Lightning?”

“Yes, ma’am!” Lightning said, giving Steads a mock salute.

With her own salute in return, Steads made her way out of the room, leaving Rainbow Dash and Lightning alone again. On her part, Rainbow was content with falling asleep right then and there. It had been a good fifty or so hours since she had so much as thought about sleep, much less managed to squeeze any in. Her entire day and night up to this point had been filled with poking, prodding, and getting her picture taken by a giant metal box. Although it was barely eleven in the morning, Rainbow Dash was exhausted, and she couldn’t think of anything better to do that shut her eyes and get some well-deserved rest.

Unfortunately, her roommate had other plans. “So that’s a yes then?”

Rainbow blinked one eye open in annoyance. “A yes to what?” she asked.

“You’re totally gay,” he said triumphantly.

Rainbow Dash calmly lifted her pillow from behind her head and rested herself down on the bare mattress. She then proceeded to take the pillow, place it in a snug position above her muzzle and scream bloody murder into the vast expanse of pale blue linens. She sighed as she moved herself to the edge of the bed, carefully crawling into her wheelchair. With a lack of energy that would have made Steads shake her head in disappointment, she rolled over to Lightning’s bedside, dragging her IV along with her as she went.

“What do you know about that stuff anyways, kid?” she asked, resting her arm on the unoccupied portion of his comforter. “How old are you? Eight?”

“Nine,” he corrected, sticking his tongue out. “There’s this weird girl I know. She’s fifteen, and you just acted like she does whenever she gets close to a colt at school.”

“You’re comparing me to a weird girl? I wasn’t acting like anything!” Rainbow protested.

“Oh, Doctor Steads,” Lightning started, doing one of the worst mare voices Rainbow had ever heard. “Your hooves are so warm... I bet your lips are even warmer,” he said, puckering his lips.

“I-I didn’t do any of that!” Rainbow stammered, blushing as she turned away from Lightning. “Steady Hooves is my doctor! Your doctor!”

“Oh, calm down, you,” Lightning said, punching Rainbow Dash lightly on the shoulder. “I’m only kidding. If it cools your jets, I think you’d look good together. You think she’s hot, yeah?”

Rainbow Dash broke right then, laughter bursting out of her every pore. “How old did you say you were again?”

For a while, Lightning and Rainbow sat like that, laughing and hitting each other like some sort of bad old-timey sitcom. Rainbow leaned back in her chair, smiling warmly up at the ceiling as Lightning picked his book back up. Now getting a better look at it, Rainbow saw that it lacked both a title and cover.

Intrigued, she pushed the book back down, forcing Lightning to look at her. “So, whatcha reading there?”

“What are you? Some kind of egghead?” he asked.

“Show me the stupid book,” Rainbow Dash demanded.

“It’s a new one, they haven’t released it in stores yet,” he boasted, showing her the title page. “Daring Do and the Phoenix Pool. Pretty awesome, right?”

“Awesome!?” Rainbow asked, grabbing the book from him to see it with her own eyes. A liar hadn’t been made out of him yet. “No way! How did you get your hooves on something like this!? I’ve been waiting months for the release date, and you’re sitting here holding it!”

Lightning shrugged, something about it coming off as uneasy. “My father wrote a letter to the guy who writes them. He sent me over a free copy a couple weeks ago. I know this might be wrong, but aren’t you a little old for Daring Do anyways?”

“Old for Daring Do?” Rainbow asked, shocked. “That’s like being too old for water!”

Lightning smiled. “Would you... like to read it with me? I’m not that far in yet, I just started today and you kept interrupting me. We can start from the beginning if you want?”

Rainbow Dash let her own grin rise up. She clambered up into Lightning’s bed, scooting him over a bit as she did so. “Yeah,” she said, wrapping her foreleg around the colt. “I’d love to read it with you.”


I don’t really feel like myself anymore. I’m still me of course, but I just feel... different now. Older somehow? I don’t know. All I know is that I don’t like it. The entire time I’ve spent here so far I’ve been acting like a filly trapped in a dark room.

Well, at least I did until I really got to know Lightning. That’s his name, by the way. He reads Daring Do just like me, can you believe that? He’s one awesome colt if you ask me. Then again, he’s still kind of a little dweeb. He can’t keep to himself at all; he didn’t even cut me a break after what happened with Steads.

Oh. Right. You still don’t really know who that is.

Well, as I told you before, I need pretty major wing surgery. Invasive stuff, you get the drill. Basically they needed someone who knew a lot about the nerves in your wings, so they brought Doctor Steads in. She’s nice. Really nice. Fun, too. She came in talking about how she was a skateboarder. How awesome is that? Don’t peg her wrong though, she’s great at her job. She’s sweet, warm, and comforting. I like having her as my doctor a lot. She makes me feel like I’m welcome here. Like I don’t have to worry about anything, because she’s going to make it all okay. She’s really smart too, but I guess you have to be to become a doctor. And she’s pretty. Really, really pretty.

Stop giving me that look, Twilight. I don’t like my doctor like that.

Seriously, Twilight.

Stop.


“Well isn’t this just the most adorable...” Steads swooned, losing her train of thought in the moment.

Upon hearing her doctor, Rainbow Dash stirred a little in her place. Slowly, she wiped the crust off of her eyes, blinking them open as the room came into view. She looked out of the window, seeing a pale blue, slightly orange backdrop. She didn’t need to look at a clock to know that it was around Twilight. She turned to Steads, who was now staring at her with half lidded eyes the way a filly stares at a newborn puppy. As she continued adjusting to the living world, Rainbow noticed that her arm was still wrapped around Lightning’s shoulders. The book they had been reading now lay sprawled out against the comforter, opened to a random page.

Rainbow Dash cleared her throat, blushing as she scratched the back of her head with her free arm. “Hey, Doctor Steads,” she whispered, making sure not to wake Lightning. “Here for that check up?”

Steads walked around the bed, jumping up to sit on the foot next to Rainbow. “No procedures tonight,” she said, smiling as she made eye contact with Rainbow. “Just thought you might like some company.”

“Thank you,” Rainbow said, returning the smile. “I know your schedule is... is...”

Rainbow cut herself off as she caught sight of a bald spot on Lightning's head that had been bandaged up with gauze and medical tape.

“Where did he get this?” Rainbow asked, brushing Lightning's mane away ever so carefully to get a better look. “Did he get in an accident like me?” she laughed a little, breaking the mood she had created. “Bet he did, too. He must be a stunt flier himself. Probably a solid eight on the radicalness scale.”

“Rainbow Dash, you know I can’t talk about other patients’ medical information,” Steads said, pawing at Rainbow to draw her focus off of Lightning’s head. “He’s in the best hooves Equestria has right now. We’re taking great care of him.”

“I know, I know,” Rainbow said, turning away from him in defeat. “So, why did you really come out here?”

“A very boring birdie told me that you may have some things on your mind,” Steads said, moving closer to Rainbow Dash as she spoke. She placed a hoof on Rainbow’s side, giving her a reassuring look. “How have you been feeling, Rainbow?”

Rainbow sighed. There went Steads being herself again. The soft, pale moonlight bathed her tan coat like a blanket of shining silver atop pure gold. Her brunette mane glistened, drawing Rainbow into her matching brown eyes. Her lab coat draped over her back fittingly, a stethoscope hanging down from her neck. She looked tired yet serene. Stressed, but happy she was there. Rainbow couldn’t take her eyes off of this mare for that reason alone: she found joy in something so distressing to others and spreading that joy to everypony around her. It was a quality Rainbow admired. It was selfless, how she stuck by her patients like she was doing right now. Some may have even called it loyalty.

For one short moment, frozen in time, Rainbow let her guard down.

“Not my best, Steads,” she said, taking comfort in their first name basis. “I really don’t like hospitals. I was here once and I felt really alone. My friends came to visit a few times, yeah, but not enough. Most of the time I spent to myself reading, but...”

“... but you were in the trauma wing,” Steads finished, a disheartened expression taking over her features. “I read your medical history. The things you must have seen... I’m so sorry, Rainbow Dash.”

“Nah, don’t sweat it,” Rainbow said, waving her off with a hoof. “It was just a little scary, you know? Sleeping somewhere where every other minute there’s somepony being rushed down the hall with blood all over them. I never.... I never really got over all of that. I just haven’t like hospitals ever since. I get pretty nervous. The drugs help, though. I would probably be huddled in a corner if it wasn’t for that stuff you gave me.”

Steads laughed entrancingly, punching Rainbow on the shoulder lightly. “You? Huddled up in a corner? Nah, you’re way too cool for that. I couldn’t picture it.”

Despite herself, Rainbow laughed a little too. “Isn’t the first rule of therapy not to laugh at your patients?” she asked with only half-seriousness.

“Lucky for both you and my medical license, I’m not a psychiatrist,” Steads said. “Just a pony who doesn’t mind lending an ear.”

“Well, the truth is, that whole ‘huddling up in a corner’ thing isn’t so far off,” Rainbow clarified, withdrawing into herself slightly as she elaborated. “I get kind of anxious sometimes. Like, there was this one time where I had to perform at a young fliers' competition, right? Well, I got stage fright. Bad stage fright. I resembled this really shy friend of mine more than I did myself, and when I wasn’t rocking myself back and forth whispering, I was trying to avoid all of my friends. I didn’t want them to think of me as a failure, or as somepony who was weak like that.”

“So, what happened?” Steads asked with genuine interest in the story. “Did you ever perform?”

“Uh, not exactly,” Rainbow Dash said, shuffling her hooves as she shifted in place. “My best friend kind of fell to her imminent death right before I was about to go on.”

“What?” Steads asked, her jaw hanging way down from the rest of her mouth.

“It’s okay though, I sort of ended up saving her,” Rainbow continued, growing a little more confident as she went along. “She had fake wings that burnt up from the heat, and when she fell, Spitfire, Soarin, and Fleetfoot flew down to save her. Her legs were flailing, and she accidentally knocked them all out. So right in the middle of my performance I saw all of this and flew down to save her. I almost didn’t make it, and I wouldn’t have if it didn’t happen.”

“If what didn’t happen?” Steads asked.

“The sonic rainboom,” Rainbow Dash said. “I broke the sound barrier on my descent, and it exploded with color. I managed to catch all four ponies just before they hit the ground, and I brought them all the way back up to the Cloudsdale colosseum. Princess Celestia saw the whole thing, and so did my other friends.”

“Rainbow Dash, that’s amazing!” Steads gaped, her jaw still having yet to return to a healthy position. “You’re a hero! You saved your friend and three members of the Wonderbolts!”

“Yeah, I am pretty awesome, aren’t I?” Rainbow boasted.

“You really are,” Steads said in an almost song-like tone. She brought a hoof to her mane, flipping her hair back from in front of her eyes as she spoke. Rainbow Dash visioned it in slow motion. Rainbow Dash nearly choked. “But Rainbow, after the competition, how often have you had these panic attacks?” Steads asked.

Rainbow shrugged. “They come and go in waves,” she replied, trying her best to phrase that correctly. “Some days I feel anxious for one reason or another, other days I don’t. When I got here though, I felt like all of my stress was just piling on and on,” she said.

Steads nodded as she thought for a moment. “You know,” she began, a grin forming on her muzzle. “I used to be afraid of hospitals too.”

“You... you did?” Rainbow asked.

“Yep,” Steads confirmed. “It wasn’t just a little fear either. I wouldn’t even step into the place! My dad always had to ask the pediatrician to make house calls for me. When I was really little, my mother got sick and passed away in a hospital, so I never wanted to even look at one from that point on.”

“I’m really sorry to hear that,” Rainbow said, placing her own hoof on Steads for a change. “I lost my mother when I was young too. What made you change your mind?”

“When my father remarried and my stepmother had my little sister, I learned a very important lesson about hospitals,” Steads said, drawing on her old memories. “They weren’t a place about death. Death is just something that comes to them on its own. Hospitals are all about life. Not just new life either, older life too. Hospitals are giving ponies a chance to live again. I wanted to take part in that. I wanted to give ponies a second chance at life. That’s why I became a surgeon,” she finished.

Rainbow closed her eyes, smiling softly to herself. “I don’t think I’m scared anymore.”

“Of hospitals?” Steads asked, tilting her head sideways.

“No,” Rainbow corrected, looking back up at Steads. “Of the surgery. I was afraid something would happen and I wouldn’t be able to fly again. But... I think I trust you. I want the surgery, Doctor Steads. I want you to fix my wing. I want to try.”

“That’s so good to hear, Rainbow,” Steads said, grasping Rainbow’s hoof in both of her own. “When I was a neurosurgical fellow at Trottingham University, our chief of surgery, Doctor Clean Cut, always told us that there was no room for fear in the O.R.. Not from patients, not from surgeons, not from anyone. He said we have to have confidence, because if we let fear of failure into us, we will fail fearfully.”

“I hope you would start already,” Lightning grumbled from next to Rainbow Dash, rolling over as he attempted to will himself back to sleep. “Maybe if you gave Rainbow some anesthesia I'd actually get some quiet around here. You’re both just as bad as that weird girl.”

Rainbow Dash and Steads looked at each other briefly before simultaneously breaking into uncontrolled, heartfelt laughter.


I think that was the best night I had in this place. We all just sat and talked for hours. It ended up that Steads’ shift had actually ended before she even came into the room. Knowing that made me feel even better I think. To know that she cared enough to come see me even when she didn’t have to. That made me happy. She's a really good pony, Twilight.

I miss you girls a lot. I know I’ve said it enough in this letter, and I know it’s only been a few days. I meant to write you earlier, but some things came up. I’m going to get to those, even though I don’t really want to. But that’s really why I wrote you this letter, so it’s happening.

Lightning is probably the single coolest colt I’ve ever met. He’s just like me, Twi’. Just like me. I know, I’m repeating myself, but you have to hear it. Some ponies literally got down to it with a stick of dynamite and made a second me in dude form. He tells me all of these stories about his family, they’re all crazy. In a good way, that is. I haven’t gotten to meet them yet. For some reason, I don’t think I will.

By the way, it took me two days to figure out that that weird girl he talks about... is his sister.

He told me it took him two hours after she left the first day for him to figure out he missed her.


Steads took another elegant swig of her wine, sighing blissfully as she brought the glass to her lips. “Mmh,” she hummed, relishing in the relaxing burn of the alcohol as it ran down her throat. “This is really wonderful,” she commented.

“Thanks,” Rainbow Dash said, offering her a contented smile as she drank from her own glass. “It’s a really old piece. Princess Luna gave it to me as a token of gratitude after the Vanhoover incident,” she explained.

“I wasn’t talking about the wine,” Steads said, a playful smile tugging at her lips.

Rainbow blushed, looking deep into Steads’ eyes. Steads was cuddled up against Rainbow, her mane falling back onto Rainbow’s shoulder as she sat. She was soft and warm, and for some reason, Rainbow’s couch was at least ten thousand times more comfortable tonight than it had ever been in her entire life. Rainbow outstretched a hoof, running it through Steads’ silky mane and coat, eliciting another pleased sigh from the doctor. Steads looked back at Rainbow, a strong blush now forming on her face as she met Rainbow’s own rose-colored eyes. She softly bit at her bottom lip, succeeding to make what Rainbow would later call the most adorable expression to ever be invented by pony kind.

Steads brought her hoof to Rainbow, lightly brushing the mane out from in front of her face. She slowly brought her muzzle closer to Rainbow’s, tension building in both mares as they began to feel the other’s breath on their lips. Rainbow closed her eyes as her entire emotional being jumped frantically about inside her body, threatening to overflow and escape.

As Steads made it to within a inch of Rainbow’s mouth, she stopped suddenly. “I got her stethoscope,” she said.

“Wh... what?” Rainbow asked, opening her eyes as her face contorted in utter confusion.

“I said,” Steads began, her voice now a lot rougher and squeakier than Rainbow Dash remembered. “I got her stethoscope again. We can go sneak into the doctor’s lounge,” she said.

Rainbow groaned as her eyes inadvertently cracked open, revealing a colt that was way too enthusiastic for however early it was that morning. She rolled over in bed, adjusting herself to the waking world as she searched for the wall clock. As it came into vision, she let out another grumble. Five thirty. What nine-year-old gets up at five thirty?

“Am I ever going to get some sleep without one of you waking me up,” Rainbow asked, turning back around to Lightning. “I was having a really good dream.”

“Yeah, whatever, look” he replied, shrugging off Rainbow’s complaints as he held up Steads’ stethoscope. “I grabbed it from her last night when she was talking to you. That mare’s eyes were glued to you, she didn’t even feel a thing! Great teamwork, by the way.”

Rainbow, now fully awake, sat up in her bed and looked at lightning. She tapped her hoof on the bed anxiously, clearing her throat before she spoke. “How much of that conversation did you actually hear, buddy?” she asked.

“Enough to know you saved some filly from becoming an omelette,” he said, causing Rainbow to squinch up her face in disgust as she pictured the scene. “You’re like, the most awesome pony I’ve ever met. I didn’t even like you at first. Really goes to show that you can’t judge a book by how gay it is,” he concluded.

“Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not how that saying goes,” Rainbow said, laughing as she ruffled Lightning’s mane. “Now remind me again why we would want to break into the doctor’s lounge?”

“Taffy,” Lightning explained.

“Taffy?”

“Taffy.”

“Forgive me for questioning this well thought-out scheme,” Rainbow said, staring at Lightning incredulously. “But wouldn’t it be easier to just buy taffy from the candy machine next to the nurses station? A place we sort of, you know, have access to.”

“You don’t understand,” he argued, giving her a hard glare. “This isn’t just any taffy. This is Baltimare saltwater taffy.”

“Baltimare saltwater taffy?” Rainbow asked.

“It’s also known as the best thing you’ll ever eat in your life,” he explained. “And it doesn’t come around often. The only time the doctors get their hooves on it is when Doctor Steads calls in one of her old friends from med school in for a consult. He comes all the way from Johns Hoofkins, can you believe it? Anyways, he has tons of the stuff since he lives in Baltimare, and he brings it here whenever he comes. I’m not letting this opportunity pass me by, and I need your help to get in.”

Unbeknownst to Lightning, Rainbow had stopped listening, her mind fixated on something he had said. “Steads called him in for a consult? Who is he? Have you met him before? What does he practice?”

“I used to be at Johns Hoofkins,” Lightning said, shrugging. “But Doctor Steads says I’ve never met him before. I do know that he’s an oncologist, though. For some reason I’ve never heard of him talking to someone else at Ponyville General. He just comes here once a month or so then leaves with a trail of taffy. Which, if I may remind you, might be gone if we don’t book it soon.”

“Yeah yeah, we’ll get the taffy, kid,” Rainbow assured halfheartedly, brushing herself off as she jumped out of bed. “What’s your master plan?”

“Okay, well, there’s something in hospitals called contact isolation,” Lightning said, placing his hooves on the bed in concentration. “It’s what they put ponies on when touching them can make them really sick. Outside of every isolation room is a box of protective gowns that the doctors and nurses wear when they enter one of the rooms. All you need to do is take one of those gowns, and with Steads’ stethoscope around your neck, you’ll look like an M.D. for sure.”

“Dash, M.D.?” Rainbow asked to nopony in particular. “I like the sound of that. I could barge into rooms looking all cool and professional or something. Just one problem: how are we going to dress you up? I think being a doctor has a... height requirement,” she said.

“Already thought of that,” Lightning said. “I’ll be your patient. You can look like you’re walking me to somewhere, I’ll point you in the direction of the doctor’s lounge. You ready to move out?

Rainbow saluted. “Yes sir, Major Lightning, sir!”

And they were off. Rainbow slowly crept out of the room with Steads’ stethoscope around her neck, scanning the hallway for one of those contact gowns. Spotting one a few rooms away, Rainbow went prone, inching along towards the doorway in an attempt to remain under the radar. She was suddenly overcome with the most profound sense of deja vu as she remembered the Daring-Do-driven actions she had made the last time she had been a patient at Ponyville general. She grabbed the gown, throwing it over her as she stood up and tried to save face. She looked around, only to see that nopony was paying her any mind.

“So much for round the clock supervision,” Rainbow muttered under her breath as she walked back to her own doorway. She pushed Lightning’s wheelchair with one hoof, moving out into the hallway past the nurses station. None of them even batted an eyelash. They continued, rounding corners as Lightning pointed Rainbow Dash in the direction of the lounge. In the early hours of the morning like those, there were rarely any doctors around. Usually, they came in around eight or nine, and the only physicians in the hospital were the residents and emergency surgeons.

Usually.

Rainbow turned the knob carefully when she found the door to the doctor’s lounge, peeking her head inside to see if the coast was clear. Looking safe enough to her, Rainbow Dash entered the room slowly, trying to find any sign of the so-called greatest taffy ever. It wasn’t long before her eyes met a bowl of the snow white candy in individual plastic wraps, just waiting to be ripped open and devoured with gusto. Rainbow could feel her mouth watering already.

Then she heard the door open behind her. Without any thought or hesitation, Rainbow dove under a nearby counter, out of sight from the entering ponies. She held her breath, trying her hardest not to be noticed as the ponies began talking.

“What was the tumor's preoperative diameter?” asked a gruff male voice. Rainbow heard the shuffling of what sounded sort of like plastic in his hooves. “You only gave me his postop scans.”

“Three and a quarter centimeters,” replied a familiar female voice that Rainbow identified as Doctor Steads. “The chemo wasn’t giving us the results that onco hoped for, so I made a tough call and went in anyways.”

“A very tough call it seems,” he commented wryly. “By the looks of these, the postoperative tumor size was just around—”

“Three and a quarter centimeters,” Steads interrupted, finishing his thought. “When I opened him up and got a better look of things, I took note that the tumor had wrapped itself around his medulla oblongata as it grew, something I couldn’t see from just looking at the M.R.I.,” she explained.

“The area of the brain that controls the heart and lungs,” the stallion said to himself, sighing. “So what did you do next?”

Steads paused for a moment. “I closed him up,” she said monotonously. It was as if that single line had ripped all of the life from her body, draining her of all emotion. “There was no safe cut I could make there without killing him on the spot.”

“I understand,” he assured Steads, his tone growing deeper. “What is your planned course of action now? Does the colt know I'm here?” he asked.

“Palliative,” Steads said, letting out a heavy sigh. “And no, I didn't tell him. I never tell him when you're coming around. There’s nothing more we can do here, Heartsong. I don’t know why you sent me a kid with a D.N.R. in the first place. You knew how bad his condition was, you’ve been his doctor for the past two years. All it did was cause his family stress and give them false hope. They haven’t been here in days, you know, and they’re probably going to blame me for all of this. Can you at least tell me what was the point?” she asked with more than a little anger present in her voice.

“You’re Doctor Steady Hooves,” he said as if that somehow explained everything. “I was hoping you could pull off a miracle.”

“A miracle? That’s why you gave him to me?” Steads asked in an accusatory tone. Rainbow could feel her staring daggers into Heart’s very soul. “You wanted a miracle. So what the hell am I supposed to say to Lightning now? Somehow I doubt that telling him 'Sorry, but there’s not enough miracles to go around, kid,' is going to fly so well.”

Both Steads and Heartsong looked up suddenly as they heard the lounge door open and close, but by the time they got a glimpse of the door clicking shut, there was nopony in sight.


Headaches. That’s what he told he had, Twi. Headaches. Yeah. I bet he’s got a pretty killer headache going on with that too-big-to-cut tumor growing under his skull.

I know. I’m a horrible pony. I shouldn’t be angry at some kid for lying to me. I just... I don’t know, Twilight. I just thought he could trust me more, okay? I don’t know what you expect from me. I don’t know what anyone expects from me anymore. I can’t do this like you all think I can. I’m not this strong. I’m not the Rainbow Dash I thought I was.

I’m scared of how I’m supposed to handle this, Twilight. What would you do? How do you even talk to him after hearing that? What will Steads think of me when she finds out that I listened in on her private conversation? I don’t know what to do. I need some help and the drugs aren’t working anymore. I wish that I could go back to Winsome Falls and tell myself to never jump off that cliff. To never have gotten into any of this. It’s an awful thing to say, but I wish that I could have just never met Lightning. I keep saying this because I need you to get it through your head:  I don’t know. I just don’t know. Anything. What to do, what to say, any of it. I need help. I can’t do this alone, Twilight. I can’t even look at Lightning the same anymore.

The worst part about it all is how optimistic he is. You would have never guessed it if you met him, Twi’, he’s the greatest colt ever. I feel such a connection with him whenever I’m with him. He’s daring, adventurous, and just plain old awesome. When Lightning and I are left alone he tells me stories. His drawer is filled with every knick knack you could imagine. He would say ‘See, this is from a gold mine’ or ‘See, this is from my brother’ or ‘See, this is from my father,’. He never stops talking to me, and when we aren’t talking, we’re reading together, or just being. I do that now. I just be.

I’ve been with Lightning for three days and all I really know is that he really likes to steal things from the doctors and wait until they notice it’s gone. Like he’s some great philosopher combined with the petty thief speaking great words of wisdom that we had never thought about. Silent words that change our lives in ways we sometimes just don’t understand. He steals from them and speaks in a language only I understand the translation of.

You’d never think to miss something unless you knew that one day it might be gone.


“Man, I wish we had gotten some taffy,” Lightning complained as he hopped up onto his bed and tucked himself in. “Too bad Steads and her friend came in. You got out of there without either of them seeing you, right?”

“Yeah...” Rainbow Dash said, drawing out her unfocused response. She jumped up next to him on his bed, staring down at her own hooves instead of Lightning. “Sorry about that, Sport.”

“It’s no big deal,” he said, shrugging. “Doctor Steads usually brings me a couple pieces anyways,” he explained.

Rainbow Dash lifted her head up to look at Lightning. He had a relaxed smile on his face as if the world's problems didn’t mean a thing to him. His forelegs were behind his neck in a kicked back position, a few strands of his mane getting in the way of his eyes. Rainbow hadn’t noticed it before, but now she did: Lightning was breathing through his mouth. She dared to say that he had been breathing manually whenever he was awake. It wasn’t that big of a revelation, but after hearing what Doctor Heartsong had claimed about Lightning’s situation, it made her all the more nervous. It made her want to pack up and leave this behind, or just ignore the subject until one of them was discharged.

But she knew she had to bite the bullet on this one, so she did.

“Lightning,” Rainbow Dash began, speaking in a soft and low tone. Lightning’s ears perked up as she mentioned his name. “Can I ask you something important?”

“Yeah,” he said, fearless of the unknown question. “Anything for you, Dash.”

Rainbow swallowed hard. That might not still apply in a minute. “Where did you get the scar in the back of your head?” she asked.

In one moment, frozen in time, all of the blood drained from Lightning’s face.

“W-what?” he asked.

“Lightning, please answer me,” Rainbow insisted, tilting her head as her eyes became more concerned.

“Rainbow Dash, I—”

“It was Doctor Heartsong, Lightning,” Rainbow said, letting out a heavy sigh. “That’s who Steads called in for a consult. That’s who was in the doctor’s lounge with her.”

Lightning looked at Rainbow with a mixture of remorse and hurt. His mouth was half open, moving every now and again to try and form words that never spoke. He looked down, staring at his own hooves as he became completely lost in the moment, unable to so much as conjure up a coherent thought. His breathing slowed as he looked back up at Rainbow, nothing but confusion remaining on his features.

“How much did you hear?” he asked, his voice cracking even more than usual.

Despite herself, Rainbow allowed a small smile to grace her muzzle before softly brushing Lightning’s mane out of his eyes. “Enough to know that you’re the most awesome pony I’ve ever met,” she said.

He stared at her, mouth agape in utter shock. “You... you don’t hate me?” he asked in disbelief.

“Come on, kid, how could I hate you?” Rainbow replied, scooting over to be closer to Lightning. “You’re like, at least half as radical as I am. Maybe even sixty percent, but that might be pushing it,” she mused.

“I thought...” he began, shuffling his hooves as he spoke. “I thought you wouldn’t want to hang out with me if you knew that I was like this. Every time I get a new roommate, they want to leave the second they find out about me. It’s too hard for them, or to depressing, or something of the sort. And all they ever care about is themselves. They just want their meds or to get out of here. You were different. You actually wanted to spend time with me, you didn’t care that I was really young or that I was mean to you. I didn’t want to tell you this because... I didn’t want you to leave me. Please don’t leave me, Rainbow Dash.”

Rainbow grabbed Lightning with all her might, pulling him into a tight embrace. “I will never leave you,” she said.

When the hug broke, Lightning pulled away and smiled, rubbing his hoof against his eyes. “You know, the worst part about being sick,” he started, looking out of the room toward the nurses station. “Is that they give you all the free ice cream you ask for. The worst part about that is realizing that there’s nothing more they can do for you. Ice cream can’t make everything okay.”

Rainbow didn’t respond, choosing only to look into Lightning’s eyes as he spoke. She lightly stroked his mane with her hoof, trying everything she could to comfort him while attempting to avoid touching the scar on the back of his head.

After a moment, Lightning spoke again. “Do you believe in angels, Rainbow Dash?”

Before she realized she didn’t have the heart to tell him, she told him, “Not lately.”


And I just lay there waiting for him to hate me. But he doesn’t know how to.

So he never does.


“My parents pray for me a lot,” Lightning said, his focus drifting elsewhere in the room. “They think that somehow it will make me better. That somepony will hear them. All it ever does is make them even sadder,” he said.

“I get what that’s like. I lost my mom when I was your age,” Rainbow Dash said, returning her gaze to the floor. “It was really hard for both me and my dad. My grades dropped to their lowest ever, and I just got really depressed. Every night I would go to my room and pray to whatever god I could think of to get her back, or to at least just be saved from everything I was feeling.”

“So what happened to you?” he asked, eyes fixed on Rainbow. “Did they answer?”

“No, but my father did,” Rainbow explained. “He came into my room one night while I was in the middle of praying. He held me, looked into my eyes and told me that I needed to let go. I didn’t understand it at first. I mean, how could any filly want to let go of their mother?” she asked herself, reanimating the memories inside of her. “But then he told me something really important: that for every answered prayer there’s a cricket with arthritis. He said that if we can’t find answers then its because the search party didn’t invite us, and Rainbow, the crickets have arthritis. So even if we got what we wanted, there’s no music, because at the end of the day there’s still a dying nine-year-old that’s ready to take her place should she come back to us.”

Rainbow and Lightning just sat for awhile, staring at each other. So much was spoken silently right then that Rainbow didn’t even know why she asked it other than the fact that she thought he needed to say it so she asked him: “Are you scared?”

Lightning didn’t even lower his voice when he said: “Fuck yeah.”


I listened to a nine-year-old colt say the word ‘fuck’. Like he’s a battle hardened soldier smoking a cigarette as he’s about to go to war against an army of angry griffons with flamethrowers he’s gonna write to it, and if it takes him a curse word to help him get through it, then I’ll teach him to swear like Gilda’s sitting there taking notes from him as he goes.

Don’t mind me, Twilight. I’ll be out of here in a couple of weeks jumping off cliffs and taking my life for granted, and he’ll still be planted in his bed like a flower that refuses to grow. It’s not like it matters. The way I’ll live, I’ll probably meet up with Lightning again soon enough. It’s just as Doctor Stable said: this jetset life is going to kill me, and now more than ever I’m going to do everything I can to keep it up. I’m not slowing down. I’m living until I die.

But I swear to whatever god I can find in the time I have left I’m gonna remember you, kid. Gonna tell your story as often as every story you told me and every time I tell it I’ll say “See, Twilight? There’s bravery in this world. There’s a billion ponies out there huddled up in a corner protesting death.”

I’m not going to claim that I’ve learned anything other than the fact that I’m not invincible and if that’s enough to send the princess a letter then tie a yellow ribbon around it and stamp it in blue. Make it good, make it the best thing you've ever written because this time there's no editor. There's no one to give you a second chance. If I could hold my breath and stop this, I would. If I could pause time by not breathing, if we could all just take a minute, then I wouldn't gasp for air. Not once.

So hold your breath, Twilight.


“Signed... Rainbow Dash,” Rainbow said aloud, placing the quill on her nightstand as she finished. She looked up at Lightning and smiled. “You’d like Twilight, you know. She’s a librarian, I bet she has every Daring Do book five times over.”

“Will she ever come to visit?” Lightning asked. 

Rainbow shrugged in response. “Don’t know, she’s kinda busy, being a princess and stuff. I hope she’ll come around.”

Rainbow and Lightning turned to look as the door slid open, revealing Doctor Steads and a team of three orderlies behind her. She was smiling as she stood, but Rainbow could see through her. Her smile was pained. Tired. Practiced. She held a dark blue chart in her foreleg which at the top had only three words in all capitals: TRANSFER TO HOSPICE.

“Hey there,” she said in a much quieter voice than usual. “Looks like I get to see my two favorite patients again, huh?”

Rainbow could hear her crack.

“Lightning,” she began, walking toward his bed. She took his hoof in hers, getting down on his level to make eye contact with him. “These nice ponies are going to bring you to a new room, okay? A whole new place in the hospital that’s going to make you feel very good. You’ll have a new doctor now, but I promise to visit you every single day, alright?”

Rainbow couldn’t watch this any longer. Much to the surprise of everypony into the room, she struggled out of bed and got to her hooves, walking over to where Steads and Lightning were seated. Steads turned to her, and Rainbow met her gaze with a hard stare. She felt betrayed, hurt that Steads could ever let this happen. Hurt that Stable could bunk her with a dying child. Hurt that she was about to lose someone she had grown so much closer to than any of her friends back at home save for Twilight. Rainbow kept her angered expression, trying her hardest to formulate her protests in her head. Her cries to Steads to not give up. Her begs and pleads for them to do everything they could to try and save Lightning. She imagined how she would bring it to the top of the hospital food chain, even the princesses. She knew that if she wanted to she could make them try harder, even if the chances were slim.

Rainbow knew exactly what she had to do. She moved painstakingly closer to Steads, opening her mouth to speak as her emotions began to boil over inside her.

Then she turned away, lowering herself down as she pressed her lips to Lightning’s forehead. She stayed there for what felt like hours, driving every ounce of love she had into his skull. She wrapped her hooves around him, burying her face into his mane as she released from the kiss.

“Be strong, kid,” she said, her voice cracking on every syllable. “There’s no room for fear where you’re going.”

“I don’t want to leave you, Rainbow Dash...” he breathed out, returning her hug.

“No. You aren’t leaving me,” she said, tightening her grip around him. “You will never leave me, just like I will never leave you. I’ll never forget you so long as I live, do you understand that? You’re the most important pony in my entire life. And by the way Lightning, you were right. I’m gay. Really, really gay. And I can prove it.”

Rainbow turned from Lightning, planting a passionate kiss on the lips of a now extremely confused Steads. Steads closed her eyes, making a few short, confused groans before finally giving up and letting whatever was happening happen.

Rainbow looked at Lightning again as she broke the kiss. “Because of you, I’m never going to live in fear of what might happen to me. I’m going to do what I want and love who I love,” she said, looking back at a now furiously blushing Doctor Steads before continuing. “And I love you, Lightning. I love you both.”

Steads couldn’t help but interrupt. “Rainbow Dash, what in the name of Celestia—”

Rainbow Dash put a hoof to Steads’ mouth before she could continue. “You’re really hot, and maybe when I get out of here if it’s not illegal or unethical or something my friend Pinkie Pie owns this really great coffee place.”

Steads sighed, rolling her eyes in defeat. After viewing the scene from the outside, Lightning began to laugh. Soon enough, Rainbow Dash and Steads joined in, closely followed by the orderlies. They laughed and laughed for a moment. A moment frozen in time.

It was Lightning who ended the laughing fit. “Here, Rainbow Dash,” he said, pulling out a large, dark blue feather from under his covers. “This is for you.”

Rainbow’s facial expression dropped when she noticed what he was holding. “Lightning, buddy,” she said, her tone growing concerned.  “That’s... that’s your pinion,” she said. “You’ll never be able to fly without that.”

Lightning closed his eyes for a moment, giving Rainbow his own soft smile. He opened Rainbow’s forearms, placing the feather into her grasp. Rainbow could feel her chest crushing under her as he closed her hooves together, releasing what made him a pegasus to someone he had only known for a few days. Right then, the room was gone. She and Lightning stood alone. 

“Don’t you see?” Lightning asked, letting out a soft chuckle as he looked up to Rainbow Dash with gleaming eyes. 

“This is the first one I grew.”

It took a week for Ponyville to start to adjust to the sudden changes after the attack. The Nightmare took out a couple of buildings and generally terrorized many of the ponies.  An unfortunate few were locked in the schoolhouse and it acted like a prison. That is until Twilight Sparkle and the other Elements saved everypony.
The ponies of Ponyville did not enjoy that fact like you would think.   The Nightmare wasn't a pony who wished for revenge or had a misguided cause. It was much worse; the Nightmare was fair Rarity. The Element of Generosity had a weak moment and was taken over by the Nightmare. No pony is quite sure what exactly the weak moment was. With tears in her eyes Twilight lead the Elements to hit their friend with the Elements. After the fight was finished the group was heartbroken to find the body of Rarity. Though none was hurting as much as her marefriend.
Throughout the week Fluttershy didn't leave her cottage let alone feed her animal friends. Angel Bunny realized the intensity of the situation and didn't do anything that would upset her more, he even went so far as to cuddle her. If it weren't for Rainbow Dash, Angel and Fluttershy would have starved. Rainbow cooked for them both and let her foalhood friend cry on her shoulder. Angel appreciated the extra help, there was no way he could help her heal by himself.


The first few days were the hardest, Rainbow was sure. Fluttershy either cried all day, or slept, usually crying herself to sleep. She barely got the suffering mare to eat. After the third day Fluttershy started to come out of her shell, talking with her friend and finally feeding some of the animals, which Rainbow had been poorly doing. Then Sweetie Belle came over with something for Fluttershy. The young filly and her parents were clearing out the Carousal Boutique and they thought the pegasus would like to have them. It was a simple black box, inside was two earrings donning Rarity's cutie mark. Upon realizing that her love was planning on marrying her Fluttershy broke down again, ruining all of her former process.
Fluttershy knew her friend was trying to help, she honestly did. Rainbow just wanted to help her move on and deep down she knew it was the best thing to do. Whenever she would try Rarity's face would flash across her eyes or the fashionista's voice would whisper in her ear. She just couldn't stop thinking about her beloved it seemed. It all happened so fast that dreadful day.



The five Elements found Rarity in the marketplace on Ponyville, a shiver inducing laugh filling their ears. They tried to talk Rarity down, convince her to stop before things got out of control, but that failed. Reluctantly they tried to take her down by force, but Rarity proved to strong for them. She tossed them aside like a ruined piece of fabric. When that failed Fluttershy thought maybe a kiss would bring her back; she was wrong.
Twilight knew they needed Celestia's help with the situation and teleported them right into Celestia's room. At first the Princess was upset with the unannounced visit but after everything was explained Celestia got serious. She told the Elements they needed to temporarily replace Rarity as the Element of Generosity. Fluttershy was a bit suspicious at the way the Princess had said "temporarily" but she couldn't question it. Applejack and Pinkie already had a pony in mind and hurried out to find her. 
Princess Celestia asked Rainbow and Fluttershy to wait outside while she spoke to Twilight alone. They were still talking when Applejack and Pinkie returned with Octavia Melody. Fluttershy knew the mare from around; she played the Gala when they went and she had seen a few of the shows Octavia performed in. The two Earth ponies both vouched for the musician, each knowing her personally and assuring the pegasus ponies that Octavia was just as generous as Rarity. 
Twilight and Celestia finally emerged from the room and took Applejack's word about her friend. Twilight explained to the girls that Octavia would take Rarity's place as Generosity and they had to use the Elements of Harmony on their friend. She also assured Fluttershy Rarity would not be harmed, she promised.
They rushed to Ponyville and found Rarity harassing the town, claiming to overthrow Celestia and rule Equestria the way it deserved. Upon seeing Octavia she laughed at their plan, telling her friends they should give up and join her. She wanted Fluttershy to be her queen and her friends to be her generals and other high ranking ponies. They denied and she attacked and Twilight gave the word for their attack. Rarity was gone.



Fluttershy felt her heart shatter into so many pieces she was sure no pony could put it back together. The timid pegasus was no stranger with death, her father passed away when she was just  a foal and she's lost her animal friends when their wounds were to much for even her. This time was different, it was a different feeling and she could do nothing while it ate away at her.
She didn't want to get out of bed, but she knew her friends were worried. Rainbow Dash left her home eight days after her loss, she couldn’t  put off weather duty any longer. She had used her bits to pay for the grieving mare's groceries and had none left.  The yellow mare felt horrible when she found out about it but her friend refused to take her own bits. Dash also mentioned she had to go visit Octavi- her new friend, but wouldn't clarify when Fluttershy asked about her meaning.
Which lead to the pegasus walking towards Ponyville to check on the news and see how her friends were doing. Letting them know she was "okay" would be a bonus, not to mention a flat out lie. She hadn't seen them since the funeral, which she almost missed. Once it was over she flew back to her bed and proceeded to not move for another few days. Ponies kept stopping to ask her how she was doing because of this and while she appreciated their intent it was quickly becoming annoying, not that she would tell them.
She almost made it to the boutique when she heard a familiar voice call her name. She turned around to find Applejack and Pinkie pie approaching her, the farm pony's signature hat atop the party ponies poofy mane. It was a wonder it was still balanced on her head. Ever since the two became a couple it wasn't an odd sight to see Pinkie wearing her marefriend's hat. It was the second piece of evidence they were in it for the long run; the first being the house they built halfway between Ponyville and Sweet Apple Acres. It was a nice place and every pony helped, even Rarity ignored the dirt because she was happy to see her friends in their bliss. It was sad she wouldn't see their wedding, though she did get to see the engagement earrings donning the others cutie mark.

Fluttershy forced a small smile at her friends, "Oh, hi Applejack. Pinkie." She hoped they didn't question her to much about her happiness, she wasn't sure how long she could lie to them for long.
The normally upbeat party pony was calm when she spoke, "We haven't seen you since the funeral. How are you feeling?"
"Um...how are you girls?"
Pinkie opened her mouth to speak but was cut off by her other half, "We're good, considering what's happened. Look, Shy, we owe you an apology, leaving you out on the decision like we did. It was wrong of us." 
"I know. I forgive you, Applejack. Can we not talk about this now though?" 
"I'm sorry sugarcube but I had to tell you now. I had to say it."
Pinkie nodded, "We feel awful. I mean it was Twilight's idea to keep you out of the loop and we didn't like the idea but she kept saying if you knew you'd stop us and it was the best thing for Equestria. She hated the whole situation and it was Celestia's idea to start with and-"
Applejack put her hoof in the pink pony's mouth, "Um, I'm awful sorry about that. You know how Pinkie is."
Fluttershy gave her a genuine smile, "I know. It-it's okay. She's just being Pinkie Pie."
"It's good to see you out of your cottage by the way." Pinkie spoke around the orange mares hoof before the hoof returned to the ground. "I-we wanted to come over and check on you. Rainbow said it wasn't best. And with Octavia moving into the Carousal Boutique."
Applejack face hooved while Fluttershy gaped at Pinkie, "W-what?!"
"Didn't you hear? She's moving to Ponyville to be closer to us. That's great Applejack and I really missed her what with Applejack knowing her since she was just a filly and how many parties of Vinyl's I saw her at."
"She..no!  She can't do that!"
"Now don't get worked up Fluttershy. It'll be all right." 
"No, Applejack! It isn't all right."
Applejack put a hoof on her friend's shoulder, "Just giver her a chance sugarcube. Don't you think Rarity would've wanted-"
"Rarity isn't here AJ!  Nopony knows what she would have wanted but it doesn't matter now because she's gone!" With a determined look in her eye Fluttershy spun on the spot and ran towards the Carousal Boutique. Pinkie wanted to give chase but Applejack blocked her.
"Shouldn't we go after her Applejack?" Pinkie asked concerned.
Applejack shook her head. "Naw, we can't do that honey suckle. I ain't seen Fluttershy look like that since she stared down that dragon. It's best to let her go. Besides, Octavia can handle herself. You know how she is. If there's anypony that can help Shy, it's gotta be her. C'mon, let's go back to the house."


Fluttershy could see the movers down the street, moving boxes and instruments into the boutique. Into her boutique. How could they let somepony move into Rarity's building? It was too much too soon and completely inappropriate! They should leave it how it was before.
As she approached she could hear somepony shouting, "Don't drop that! There is very sensitive equipment in that box and I will keep the bits from your pay if you break anything!"
"I'm sorry. It slipped. I won't break nothing."
"I would very much appreciate it."
The gray mare was standing outside the boutique directing three big earth ponies as they carried her things into the building. The building she had no business in.
"Octavia!"
The mare in question turned towards the call. "Oh, Fluttershy, dear, how are you? I heard you haven't come out of your cottage lately."
"You're moving into Rarity's home?"
Catching the look and tone the pegasus was giving her, the musician took a moment to get her thoughts together. "Fluttershy, why don't we go up to the bedroom to talk? My good stallions, just sit the boxes in the middle of the room and the instruments near the walls. I'll set it all up later on." Without a second thought the mare walked upstairs. It only took a passing thought for Fluttershy to follow her. The bedroom, Rarity's bedroom, was cleared out and now the room was a different layout. The furniture was unknown to her, assumingly Octavia's. She assumed this was the first room the movers tackled.

"Fluttershy, do you have a problem with me?" Octavia asked, her voice calm.
Fluttershy nodded, "You're trying to replace her."
Magenta eyes widened at the accusation, "What?"
"You're the new Element of Generosity. You're moving into her home. My friends love you and they hardly know you, except for Applejack and Pinkie apparently."
"Pinkie frequented Vinyl's parties and as for Applejack. My family is good friends with hers. I've known her for so long now, she's like a sister to me." There was a fondness in her voice as she thought of memories, but the fond tone was replaced with a mix of sincerity and being insulted, "Believe me when I tell you the last thing I want to do is replace Rarity. She was a good mare and I'm deeply sorry about what happened."
"Everypony is sorry but none of them know how I feel!"
"I know how you feel." 
Fluttershy shook her head, "You couldn't know."
She recoiled when she was met with a glare. "I understand you're hurting. I get it, but you do not have to take it out on me. I realize I'm the one to vilify here. That does not mean I'm going to let you stand there and tell me how I couldn't know how you feel. I've lost my marefriend too Fluttershy."
'What?"
"Why on Equestria do you think you haven't seen Vinyl around anymore? That Pinkie Pie doesn't talk about any of her parties or why nopony talks about her tracks. She passed away, she got really sick and the doctors couldn't help her. I watched her go; told her I loved her and how much I would miss her. Vinyl told me to move on and be happy with life before she passed on." Tears filled the musician's eyes but she  refused to let them fall. She saw the guilt in  blue eyes but didn't stop. "I didn't at first much like yourself. My music suffered, I didn't eat or go anywhere. Applejack came to Canterlot to cheer me up and I cannot tell you how long she stayed with me until I finally realized I was letting Vinyl down by not moving on with my life."
"I'm sorry about Vinyl. This is different though. You killed my Rarity."
"So did you." Octavia countered.
"You got to say goodbye. You knew before that she was going to pass. Rarity was just gone." Tears flowed down her cheeks as she looked at the floor.
A gentle hoof lifted her gaze. "I know that we essentially killed Rarity. I'm sorry. If you could have talked to her before hand, don't you think she would have told you that if you needed to do what you did to save Equestria she would have told you to do so?"
The pegasus realized she was right, Rarity would have sacrificed herself if it meant Equestria would have been safe from more harm. "She would have wanted us to do everything we could have to avoid that."
"You did that dear. Twilight told me how you tried so many ways to save Rarity, but the Nightmare was too strong."
"I failed her.." Fluttershy's rump hit the floor, her eyes once again meeting the floor, though this time the gentle hoof was ready.
"You didn't fail her. You did what you could. She knew you loved her. I know you miss her but I think you need to start moving on."

"I can't forget her!" The pegasus' wings flared up as she snapped.
Octavia shook her head. "That's not what I said. I said move on not forget her. She wouldn't want you to mourn forever. You can miss her everyday, think about her every hour, but you can't forget to keep going with your life."
"I miss her so much. It's hard."
"I know. But you have friends that will be there for you. I hear Rainbow's been with you since the first night. I'm sure any of your other friends would have done the same." Octavia moved to gently stroke the pink mane of the crying mare. "You aren't the only one hurting Fluttershy. Think about Rarity's parents and her sister. What about Twilight and the others? They loved her too in their own ways. They must miss her as well."
"I hadn't thought of that." Fluttershy said guilty. She didn't consider how her friends were feeling.
The gray mare sat beside her, "Just take this one minute at a time. It will be hard at first, but your friends will help you every step of the way. Even me."
"You...want to help me?" Blue eyes locked on magenta, staring in disbelief. She came to give this mare a stern talking to for replacing Rarity in Ponyville, but she still wants to help?
"Yes. I know your heart is in the right place. I understand what you're feeling right now. I'll help you through it."
"I...I don't know what to say."
"You still think I'm trying to replace her?" Before Fluttershy could respond Octavia continued, "I promise you I'm not. I felt extremely uncomfortable when Mayor Mare said the only available property was Rarity's and she didn't have a will so the boutique went to the bank. If I could have chosen somewhere else to live I would have. I would have even lived near Applejack but a music store would not get much business there."
"Music store? You're going to open a music store here?"
"Well, yes. I'll sell instruments, repair them, even play at important events or where ever I am wanted."
"I've always enjoyed music. Rarity took me to a few of your performances. You're wonderful."
"Thank you dear. I realize it will take you some time to be comfortable with me, but I'll help you with anything you need."

Fluttershy took a moment to herself to consider everything she had been told. In her grief she had neglected many things; her friends, her animals, her friends feelings, and her own needs. Rarity would not be pleased to see her like this. She had to make her unicorn proud of her, live on for her not constantly grieve. 
She sighed as she looked at the new Element. "It won't be easy."
Octavia nodded, "Sadly, no, it won't. I have faith in you Fluttershy."
"Thank you. I'm sorry I blamed you."
"It's quite alright dear. Would you like to help me settle in? Twilight will be here shortly to help me with the heavy objects. Maybe you can help me decide where I could put my furniture? Oh what am I thinking that's a terrible idea. I'm sor-"
"Actually, Octavia, that sounds like a good idea."
She was met with a concerned look while Octavia spoke. "Are you sure? I'm moving into her home and moving things the way I want them. Changing her home."
"I know. I should have helped them take her things out."
Octavia looked at the earrings, "I see you got what she wanted you to keep though."
Fluttershy smiled slightly, "I did. I think this will help me."
"If you're sure dear."
"I am."

Octavia stood and left the bedroom, going down the stairs and finding the movers messed up her instructions. Fluttershy didn't immediately follow, instead stopping at the door frame turning to look at the bedroom. She could still see where Rarity's furniture was, Octavia's furniture was essentially in the same place. It was easy to imagine them as Rarity's. The pegasus wiped at her eyes with a sad smile. "Goodbye Rarity. I'll always love you."

Princess Celestia's sky chariot soared through the sky as she was hurrying towards her destination, the Donkey Republic. The president of the small equine nation invited Celestia for an urgent meeting, and the Princess wasn't one to take such requests lightly. After all, Equestria didn't have many allies, and she was adamant about keeping the ones it had as such.

As Celestia was in a hurry, she opted to fly over the Southern Jungles, a mostly uncharted part of southern Equestria. Although her Palace Guard tried to make her take a full retinue along, she insisted that putting together the unit would take time, and anyway, there were no risks to be afraid of. The princess had a point surely, as that jungle was still sovereign Equestrian territory. It was just a matter of fact that nopony lived there.

Her chariot was pulled by her best pegasus guards. The four of them were great fliers, and brave soldiers, and Celestia was sure that flying over the vast San Palomino desert, then the Southern Jungles too, without rest, wouldn't pose a challenge for them.

The skies were clear, and the weather warm, but not hot. So just great for traveling. Celestia almost took a nap during the gentle flight, as her guards made an effort to steer clear of any turbulence. But suddenly, one of them spoke up:

"Hey Lieutenant. Check that out. Down there, among the trees. What could be flashing green like that?"

"Why care?" the Lieutenant dismissed him "Keep those wings flapping, and your eyes forward."

Celestia opened her eyes. She casually looked at her guards, then down into the jungle. She didn't see any flashes whatsoever. Whatever it was, probably didn't concern them anyway.

A few seconds later though, they all heard an elongated, high-pitched sound. The previous guard looked around, then called out in a panic:

"Bloody heck, magic missile! Evade!"

The guards violently jerked the chariot to the left. Celestia wasn't expecting the maneuver, and hit the side of the chariot. Before she could re-balance herself though, the giant ball of magic exploded just to their right, and Celestia got the brunt of it. She was launched from her vehicle, and began plummeting towards the tree canopy. Her right wing was scorched badly, and she was dazed, so she crashed through the branches, and struck the ground hard.

She immediately lost consciousness.



Celestia slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was dense bushes, they were rather blurry though. She closed her eyes, then opened them again. Now her vision cleared up a bit, and recollected the events of the immediate past. The magic ball exploding, then her fall... She also remembered her guards going down along with her chariot, although unlike her, they were still in control the last moment she remembered seeing them. They must have made a controlled crash landing.

Celestia moved her limbs. She felt a sharp pain in her left wing. Of course, as she has fallen on that one with all her weight. It must have been broken... Then slowly, carefully, with the very considerate movements of an injured pony, she got up.

The world was still spinning with her a bit, but by then she could think clearly. They got shut down, that's for sure. By what or whom, and for what purpose, she didn't know, although she wanted to find her guards first. Celestia only hoped they would be okay, and no more injured than herself.

Celestia made a few steps forward, and tried to decide which direction she should go. The forest around her was very thick, obviously not cared for by earth ponies. And the tree canopy could be barely penetrated by the Sun, although it wasn't hard for Celestia to determine from which direction it was shining. Her instinct told her that right away. And after that, she also put together in her head where the chariot could have crashed.

"South. We were flying south. So that way."

Celestia began moving, although her left wing still hurt a lot. But figuring her guards would need assistance, and as soon as possible, she thought she wouldn't have time for a proper healing spell. So she just cast an anesthetic spell quickly, and began walking.



Celestia walked at least a kilometer when she started to see tree branches on the ground. At first only smaller ones, but as she followed them, they became thicker and thicker. After several minutes, she found the crash site. Her gilded chariot was a mess, and in its state no one would have told it belonged to royalty. But there were no Royal Guards around whatsoever.

Celestia approached her chariot, and took a good look around. She feared her guards got stuck under the wreckage, but that didn't seem to be the case. Then suddenly, she heard a strange noise.

The Princess snapped to attention, her gaze following the direction her ears swiveled towards. But there was nothing there, only the thick jungle.

"Wildlife." Celestia thought. Although that thought was more like an excuse. The jungle was silent otherwise. Suspiciously silent.

She turned back to the wreckage, and took another look around. Then she also lifted up the whole thing, just in case. No living pony or dead was found.

Celestia dropped the chariot with some frustration. Where her guards could have gone? Sure, they could have set off to find her, but then she should have seen some hoofprints. The ground was soft enough all around that they would be visible. Then she saw something. Something else.

It was a barely visible trail, starting a bit further away from the wreckage, and running towards the northwest. It looked like as if someone was dragged away... Celestia didn't want to think about the worst, but nonetheless, she started to become concerned. But as she had finally found a clue, she began to follow it.



Celestia has been barely following the marks for a minute when she heard that strange sound again. Only this time, it was clearer. She perked her ears, then looked in the direction of the sound. As if it was... talking? Maybe it was, but she couldn't take out any words. But then...

"AHHH NO!!! Heeeeeeeelp!!!"

Celestia heard the screaming. And that was definitely the voice of one of her guards. She started to gallop towards the source of the sound. Now she was sure her guards were dragged away, and she also had an idea by whom. The green flashes, the magic ball, the no visible hoof marks... She started to put together a theory, but she needed visual evidence.

And she didn't need to wait much for it. As the Princess reached a small clearing, she found herself face to face with five changelings. By the looks of it, they were very surprised, more so than Celestia. They even stepped back a little.

At first, they just stared down each other. Then, Celestia talked, not in her diplomatic voice.

"It's you again! What did you do to my guards?!"

The changelings didn't answer. Maybe they didn't even understand, although they should have understood the context clues. Like why an alicorn in front of them was so angry.

"Answer me!!!" Celestia demanded, tapping a hoof on the ground violently.

Maybe she shouldn't have done that. The changeling in the forefront, wearing armor, screeched something, and his squad spread out, and began casting at Celestia.

Celestia got caught a bit off-guard, and the first few bolts of magic actually hit her, before she leapt to the cover of a tree. But she shrugged that off, as per her massive magical resistance.

The Princess now knew she wouldn't solve this situation with diplomacy, and lit up her horn. A member of the changeling unit was out in the open. Celestia charged up one of her more powerful combat spells, and released it. The changeling got evaporated into arcane dust.

"Right. Maybe I'm overdoing it."

For her next target, Celestia opted for a much weaker spell, to conserve her magicka. The changeling was flying right at her, but she picked him off mid-flight. He has fallen to the ground, with the chitin burnt on his chest.

The next two were harder targets, but the Princess' delayed-burst magical sphere dealt with them while still in their cover, causing the last changeling, the one wearing armor, to leave for another tree.

Celestia didn't stall, and began firing at him, but he ran so fast that her spells only hit the trees behind him. They spitted out big chunks of wood where they were hit, while the thinner ones outright exploded. But the changeling reached his intended destination, a large boulder.

At first they only took potshots at each other. But seeing this didn't lead anywhere, Celestia took the initiative. She also feared that her adversary -who was probably an officer based on the armor and skill- only stalled for time, so some reinforcements could catch up to him.

The alicorn cast a full-body magical shield upon herself, just in case, then left her cover. The 'ling madly fired at her, being an easy target, but his spells ricocheted off of Celestia's shield. She tried to snipe him out of his cover, but after two attempts, she just rushed up to the boulder. But by that time, the changeling was away.

Celestia angrily groaned. She walked around the boulder, then saw the changeling on the other side of the clearing. Getting impatient, she reared up, and struck the ground. Her earth pony magic, backed by her inherent magical power, sent a shockwave through the earth, but the changeling officer avoided it by flying up and staying there for a moment...

...But that was all Celestia needed to cast a beam spell, and catch the changeling in the air. The instantaneous hit couldn't be dodged, and the warrior dropped to the ground, with his armor melted. Celestia galloped up to him. He was still alive. She lifted him up using telekinesis, and talked:

"I ask again: Where are my ponies?!"

The changeling wailed something, but Celestia couldn't understand. Probably the defeated warrior didn't understand her either. So she dropped him, and cast a hologram of two pegasus guards. Celestia pointed at the shimmering depictions of the lost ponies.

"Guards. Where?"

The changeling blinked at the not-so-real ponies, and let out what could only be described as a pitiful laughter. Celestia scrunched up her nose, and squinted her eyes. She lifted up the changeling again, right up to her face.

"Where. They. ARE?!"

"Chr'asl'eesht, ah-ah-ah-a!"

Celestia could only guess what the changeling just said, but at the same time, she was almost sure what it was. She whacked the changeling to the ground violently.

"Fine. I'll find them on my own. But an alicorn's wrath be upon you if they are hurt..."
> The Hunt
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Celestia continued her journey, deeper inside the jungle. After she was far enough from the clearing where those unlucky changelings met her, she stopped, and looked at her wings. The right one didn't really hurt, but her primary feathers were burned pretty badly. But she started to feel her left wing again, as the anesthetic spell was wearing off. She decided to give herself ten minutes to heal her wing at least to a condition where it wouldn't cause her any pain.

After almost fifteen minutes, Celestia opened her eyes, and stopped casting the self-healing spell that enveloped her wing in a golden hue. She tried out the appendage, and to her satisfaction, it barely caused her any discomfort. Of course, she couldn't use it yet to fly, but she could glide using them. And that could still prove to be advantageous, she thought.

Celestia straightened up from her meditative stance, and walked on. As she treaded the ground, she could feel the life force of the jungle being... corrupted. A different kind of magic besides that inherent to every living being was mixed among it. Celestia knew at that point that corrupting force was the changelings. She only didn't yet know what could they want there. Although if her understanding was right previously, then Queen Chrysalis was present too. And if she was present, her previous encounter wasn't just a lost changeling patrol. Their plans must have been grand.

The princess soon found a tiny body on the ground. It was a squirrel. She gently lifted it up, and realized it wasn't dead. It was just... sucked dry of emotions. Its eyes were glassy, and its breathing slow. It mustn't have been a treat for the changelings, as wild animals didn't contain the same amount or kind of love sapient beings did. But they probably couldn't be choosers in their situation. The jungle didn't have any ponies. So far...

Celestia put down the little critter with the same care she lifted it, and activated her horn. She tried to channel her own love into the being, just as Cadence showed her once. Of course, this spell didn't line up with her special talent, but nonetheless, the squirrel got up. It looked up at Celestia, then skittered away. Celestia tracked the critter with her eyes, and smiled.

"Hurry, little one. Go and find your own!"

The squirrel soon disappeared among the bushes. Then Celestia realized its kin might have just met the same fate. And she couldn't find and heal every single creature in the forest. Not until the changelings' corrupting presence was removed. But she also realized she COULD do something about that...

"So be it, you emotion-eating monster. Time for a rematch..."



Celestia hurried her steps. She wanted to find her group of guards fast, but also wanted to find Chrysalis. And she knew if one was found, the other would be nearby, too.

She also knew that during her trek, she would find several more changeling patrols. She wasn't sure if they were aware of her presence, or they only knew about her guards. But she would find that out pretty soon.

And that indeed happened soon, as she caught up to another patrol. There were four of them, including one officer, wearing the distinctive blue armor.

Celestia approached quietly. The ground was harder here than at the crash site, so she also lost track of the kidnapped guards. But her delicate steps didn't propel her fast enough. Of course, she could have just gone loud, and mow down the patrol, but that also carried the risk of alerting a much bigger group of the shapeshifting monsters. And not even Celestia wanted to fight an army of them.

"As the Magikhan would say: Weak Celestia, weak."

Celestia sighed. Remembering her own tribe, from her childhood, wasn't something she needed right then. Yet reminding herself what an alicorn was potentially capable of was something she actually needed. She had to rescue her subjects. And not from mere drones, but from Chrysalis...

Every fight should be YOUR fight. Remember that. Because if you're not in control, you have already lost.



Celestia suddenly thought of something. Wrapping herself in her own magic, she levitated up to the tallest branch of a very tall tree. The circumference of the trunk was a testament to the primeval nature of the forest, and to the fact its branches could hold a heavy pony like Celestia.

She walked along the branch with lithe steps, with her wings extended for balance. Now she was right above the changelings. They were moving away from her, towards the middle of the forest. She noticed one guard was well behind the others, and was very slow in general. He clearly wasn't aware of his surroundings. Celestia knew it was the perfect moment to strike, and leapt off from the tree branch, with her wings slightly open.

The alicorn has fallen at least thirty meters, right on top of the changeling trooper. The force of the landing immediately killed him, but Celestia was unharmed. Her hooves shattered his chitin carapace in multiple places, and his eyes were left open. The princess stepped off from her unlucky adversary, and hurried after the rest.

The three remaining guards weren't aware what just happened, they didn't hear it, and didn't check their rear either. And that was just perfect for Celestia, but she knew it would only be seconds to be noticed. The 'ling in the back was her next target. Using a silent teleportation spell, lacking the distinctive "POP" sound, Celestia ended up right behind him, then grabbed the guard's head within her magic. Then twisted it, and now it faced her. The princess then let the corpse fall the ground.

The last two guards were somewhat close to each other, and pretty close to Celestia. It was surprising to her they didn't notice the loud snap, but it suited her needs. She noticed they were walking just under a thick tree branch. Celestia cast some extreme telekinesis to quickly tear off the branch from its place, and it fell on the remaining two. They were flattened with a somewhat loud "splort".

With all of her adversaries taken out, Celestia looked around. That was good for a warmup, but she would only meet more, and bigger patrols. she thought. So she continued her trek deeper inside the jungle.



Celestia was right about the size of the patrols. The next one she spotted had eight drones. Taking these out one-by-one without alerting the rest wouldn't be easy. But maybe that wouldn't be necessary either...

An old spell came to Celestia's mind, the seeker bolt. That would follow and strike every living target in range, bouncing from one to another. That would be fast enough to kill all of them at once. Now she only needed to remember how to cast the spell exactly.

Hiding behind a tree, Celestia gave herself half a minute, and she had the arcane pattern down to a T. Ready to cast, she leaned out from cover, and released the spell. The golden bolt found its first mark in a split-second, then just as fast penetrated the craniums of all the other members of the patrol, zigzagging between them. The changelings couldn't react, they couldn't even scream. But after the spell downed the last one, it turned around and flew towards its caster. Celestia didn't expect that, and her reflexes weren't godly enough to dodge it. The high-powered magic bolt exploded in her face, and the alicorn flinched. She felt that, but the damage it caused was only superficial. Celestia rolled her eyes. That shouldn't have happened...

"It seems I forgot the last part of the spell."



After seeing the next group of hostiles, she must have been nearing the Queen herself, the Princess thought. As it was no mere patrol, but more like a strike team. It numbered at least twenty drones, including two officers, and four heavies. Celestia read the after-action reports in the wake of the Battle of Canterlot, and knew these kinds of changelings decimated her royal guard units wherever they fought in the city. Now she had the chance to return the favor in kind.

Celestia choose the safety of the tree canopy once again. Looking down at the group indicated they had a briefing going on. The officers were explaining something to the rank-and-file.

Celestia was thinking about the correct approach. Although she had the advantage of raw skill and power, the changelings were much more numerous. In a tactical sense, she was outmatched. She would have to tip the scales, somehow. If those heavies weren't present, for example, that would already be a large boon for her.

And actually... what if they weren't just "not present", but actually fought for her? Or at least one.

Celestia knew individual minds could be controlled with powerful enough magic. And it was clear ever since the great battle that changelings weren't a hive mind, but actual individuals. So mind-control spells should have worked on them as well. The princess tried to remember the correct kind of magic. Although Luna was the actual master of these, Celestia also had a good piece of knowledge about them.

Celestia didn't have to dilly-dally a lot, and cast. The iris-less blue eyes of one heavy lit up with a golden hue, and he let out a mighty roar. Then it began shooting deadly bolts of magic at his former hive-kin.

The drones got knocked out fast, but the other three heavies could take the punishment, and took out the assailant. One of the officers have survived, too. He walked up to the dead heavy to check it out.

Celestia smiled. She cast another little spell, and another heavy have gone wild, and killed the other two. Now only him and the officer remained, and they battled it out. The officer managed to take out the killer, although his armor was badly damaged. He limped around some before, somehow, got the idea to look up at the tree where Celestia was roosting.

As if he was frozen in place. The alicorn took the leap, and glided down to the shocked changeling. The changeling backed away, but Celestia followed. Then he hit a tree with his rump, and looked back in panic. He was cornered. Celestia stopped right before her. Her face was stone.

The changeling wailed two words...

"Men'yee sor'neteg! Men'yee sor'neteg!"

Celestia began smiling. She didn't know their language, but that phrase... It sounded like something from an old codex of the alicorns.

Men'yee sor'neteg... Heavenly Daemon.

The alicorns of ancient times once were forced to almost exterminate the changelings. They glassed their first mega-hive from the sky, when they were preparing to attack ponykind. And it seemed, their legend was still living on.

Celestia bent down to the horrified creature:

"And be glad I could never be as cruel as my ancestors were."

With that, the Princess moved on without fear of getting struck down from behind. She knew the changeling was more paralyzed by fear than any stun spell could manage.



As Celestia moved on, the forest was thinning out somewhat. More sunlight reached the ground, and the otherwise damp and dark forest became less creepy. More of the presence of what Celestia loved so much reinvigorated her, and she trotted even faster. But stopped as she reached even more changelings.

In a thinly grown-in area, about fifty of the monsters were grouped up. Some of them were patrolling, but most of them were assembled around... some strange pile. Celestia looked closer, and it dawned on her: that "pile" was made up of forest critters. The changelings were having a feast, and threw the bodies already sucked clean of love on top. The princess crunched up her nose in disgust. She engaged her cloaking spell...

The alicorn sneaked around the perimeter, unbeknownst to the guards she passed pretty close on occasion. Only a slightly shimmering outline of her was visible, although her visage also warped the air somewhat as she moved. But to one not expecting an invisible foe, she didn't exist.

Perhaps an invisible enemy wasn't expected, but the guards were on the nose nonetheless. They probably heard the infighting previously. All it was needed a little mistake to tip them off...

And that inevitably happened as Celestia stepped on a dry twig. A guard heard the distinctive snap, and turned his head towards the trees Celestia was hiding amongst. He moved in, while the princess stayed still.

"Ik'alav ma'vit?" the drone asked.

He walked further among the trees. When he was facing away from the princess, she leapt right behind him assisted by her wings. She grabbed the drone's head in her forelegs, and turned it.

The head stopped at an unnatural angle.

Celestia gently put the corpse on the ground. She looked at the others. They didn't notice. So she once again levitated herself up to a tree, and looked down at the commotion. At her victims. The cloaked alicorn squinted her eyes, and they lit up with magic for a moment.

The hunt would end soon.



Celestia was looking for minutes at the company-sized changeling unit, having a good time feasting upon the forest's creatures. Yet, she didn't see a good solution how she could solve the situation in an... elegant way. Sure, she could sneak past them, but she didn't want to. This forest had to be cleared of these interlopers.

So she devised a simple plan. At first she would thin them out as much as she could from up top. Then, she would let loose. It wouldn't be an elegant way, but it would be effective.

The critters of the forest were tethered to the ground by green tendrils of magic. The love-eaters were gathered around them, and choose like a pony would choose from a box of bon-bons. And after the changeling grabbed his prize, he activated his horn, and the small amount of love energy flowed into him.

Celestia saw just enough. Actually, it was more than enough to rouse her. She bent down her head, and took aim. She used an instant-charge spell, so her bright golden aura wouldn't be visible. The magic bolt struck one of the feeding changelings in the side of his head. His lifeless body skidded to a halt on the ground.

The loud combat spell grabbed the attention of every 'ling in the area. Some of them assembled around their lost hive-mate, the rest were trying to figure out the origin of the spell. A few were looking at Celestia directly, but they couldn't distinguish her from her surroundings.

The big group took flight, and tried to look among the trees. The buzzing was so loud, that the princess let go of another spell. Sure enough, it struck true, and the buzzing masked the sound just enough that the monsters just got confused again. 

After the next death occurred, the flight became a panicked rout. And after that one, the changelings finally nailed down her location, but her cloaking spell still on, not many of them hit her. 

Those who did got killed first in return.

Then Celestia cast another seeker bolt. A proper one, this time. Optimized for ten hostiles, the deadly spell sent another ten changelings to the ground, permanently.

Celestia finally decloaked. She flared her wings, and her eyes glowed with power. She boomed, in the Royal Canterlot Voice:

"DESPAIR!"

No more was needed for the already demoralized company of drones. They turned tail, and flied away from the alicorn, towards the north, probably seeking the aid of their Queen.

"Not so fast!"

Celestia pushed herself away from the branch, and glided down to ground level. The changelings got away fast, but the lanky princess' long legs propelled her fast enough to catch up. The jungle was clearing up, the ground was becoming harder. The chase finally concluded at a small rocky hill, which seemed to also indicate the end of that part of the forest.



The buzzers disappeared in crevices, and most of them in a large opening at the bottom of the hill. Celestia entered after them, and she found herself in a cave. She lit up her horn, and the darkness was replaced with a warm yellow light. The changelings were nowhere to be seen.

The princess walked deeper inside the cave. After an invisible threshold, the looks changed around her. The cave didn't appear to be a natural formation anymore. As if it was expanded by the changelings. And she couldn't have made it farther than a hundred meters when she was met by a massive door.

The circular slab of stone was adorned by runic carvings, which Celestia was sure served as a locking method. But she first tapped the door with a hoof. The appearance didn't belie the thickness, it didn't ring hollow from the other side, which indicated at least a foot of stone.

"I won't kick in this one..."

The princess then tried the common bypassing spells on the runes. The golden energy cursed through the carvings, but it eventually returned unto itself, and was smothered.

"Figuring out the correct arcane patterns could take hours. Wish Luna was here..." Celestia thought, and slightly shook her head. 

She stepped back, and looked at the door. Now she was sure she found the hideout where her guards were taken. She was sure she found the hideout of Chrysalis. 

Celestia walked outside. She remembered the crevices among the rocks of this hill. If the changelings could enter that way, perhaps she could too. She jumped up on the rocks until she reached one of them. Then it dawned on her: she was far too big to use it to get inside. And anyway, the crevice didn't seem to lead anywhere. The changelings must have blocked it somehow from the inside.

Celestia hopped from rock to rock until she tried every opening, but they all had the issues the first one had. The royal ears drooped in disappointment:

"Main entrance it is then..."

So the alicorn walked back to the stone door inside the cave. She stopped a good ten meters before it, and began charging up her horn. 

The magic she accumulated was so bright as if she brought down the Sun itself to the damp place. Then she let go of the gigantic bolt of magic, and it exploded the stone door into smithereens. Good thing she cast a basic barrier in front of herself, so the chunks flying didn't hurt her.

When the dust settled a bit, Celestia entered the hideout. Beyond the gate lied the pieces of both door and changelings. The princess gently tiptoed around them, and thought how she probably just evaded an ambush by choosing the inelegant method of entry.

"That was quite the welcome party."
> The Hive
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Celestia continued deeper inside the cave. Her hoofsteps reverberated throughout, along with the callings of the denizens of the dark place. She noticed how parts of the cave were separated with new walls, built from an unfamiliar material. But to her it looked like dried changeling goo...

The princess couldn't determine if the shrieks and cries she heard were that of fear or a call to battle, but she didn't expect those who dwelled within to just give up. But she also didn't see a changeling (in one piece) since she entered, so they must've been hiding in the chambers farther from the entrance.

Finally, a drone flew at her with a piercing screech. Celestia didn't hesitate, and shot. The drone hit the ground with a wet "pomf", and became silent. At the same time, the princess reminded herself to check her fire from then on. Her guards must have been inside, and a stray shot from her could do some damage.

After the short encounter, Celestia reached a far too organic looking door. It reminded her of a... 

She let the thought go, and stepped ahead. The door contracted from the center, and opened up enough that she fit through. Then suddenly, buzzing. Celestia aimed her lighting spell at the ceiling of the cave, and as if the walls became alive... Hundreds of changelings went at her at once, screeching a war cry. That she has woken up the hive, was an understatement.

Celestia got pinned down from the concentrated spells of all the drones. But she could bring up a bubble shield just in time, so all the magic bolts harmlessly plinked off. After the first volley of strikes, Celestia got to work though. She fired off a rapid volley of destructive spells of her own, and decimated the flying changelings. They fell down, and hit the ground by the dozens. They tried to counterattack, but it was no use, and the place where they set up the trap for the princess, became their trap.

The massacre continued until there was none, but two warriors left. One was an officer, clad in golden armor, possibly of higher rank, who fought with vile and cunning, but eventually Celestia turned a little vile as well, and brought down part of the ceiling upon him. That he didn't expect, and was crushed on the ground under the heavy pieces of stone.

The last changeling was a tiny runt of a drone. He was covering in the farthest corner of the cave. Celestia initially didn't even notice him, but then deactivated her shield, and walked up to him with ominous steps. She began, gently:

"Where are my guards, changeling?"

The changeling looked back, shivering. Celestia conjured up a picture of their guards and smiled.

"Where?"

The changeling pointed to the right of Celestia, at another one of those sphincter gateways.

"Right. And she?"

The princess brought forth the hologram of Queen Chrysalis, trying to make it as accurate as she could remember.

The little 'ling, with a still shaking foreleg, pointed in the same direction.

Celestia just nodded, and went for the door. The drone didn't even see the reaction, just covered his eyes. Probably thought his execution would come next...



Celestia made it to the next chamber. Then the next. Then the next. As she went forward, she noticed more and more of the materials were what could only be described as dried changeling goo. She must have been really close to Chrysalis.

When it seemed she couldn't move forward from one of the chambers, she began searching for some hidden exit. Or a place where she could blow the wall in... But her efforts were cut short by cackling laughter. By the laughter of a very familiar voice...

"Well, well, well, if it isn't the glorious princess of ponykind, Celestia! Nice of you to make yourself my guest."

The voice echoed throughout the chamber, but it's origins were elsewhere. Chrysalis must have projected it from her own part of the hive. Celestia nonetheless answered, hoping the Queen would hear her as well.

"Chrysalis! Where are my Royal Guards? Relinquish them now, or suffer the consequences!"

Chrysalis laughed even harder. Her pitch and the intensity started to make Celestia's blood boil.

"Oh, your guards... They were a treat, for sure! So much love in only four ponies, yum!"

"I will end you for this!" Celestia answered, with her voice raised now.

"Oh please, you pathetic failure of a ruler... You think you could harm me? Remember our last encounter. You skidded across the floor of your own castle, like a discarded piece of trash! While your ponies were witnessing how you couldn't protect them!"

Celestia was enraged, yet she didn't answer. Chrysalis was right, from a certain point of view. But it was also part of the truth the noble princess held herself back on purpose during that fateful duel. She thought a single well-directed, concentrated beam of energy would be enough to defeat the Queen. She underestimated how powerful the Queen could become juiced up on love. So when the scales were tipped against her, all she could do was to take the brunt of the attack if she didn't want to evaporate half the room of guests with a deflected spell.

Luckily, her alicorn physiology let her survive with minor injuries. But that defeat was back then. Now, Chrysalis wouldn't get away. And she wouldn't win their inevitable battle...

"If you're so sure of yourself" Celestia exclaimed finally "why don't you come out, and face me?"

"You want another beating?" answered the disembodied voice with a scoff "Fine. If you feel so inclined. But you could get rid of a little problem for me first... The chamber you're in is actually the prison of a Changeling proto-queen. These things are real brutes, you know."

Celestia looked around. She started to have a bad feeling about the situation. She doubted Chrysalis was just bluffing. Looking at the other half of the chamber, into the darkness, she saw movement...

"Their thirst for love and blood is unquenchable." Chrysalis continued, very matter-of-factly "If they can feed enough, the final part of their ascension begins, and go up against the current queen."

The princess heard the words, but had her eyes on the thing. All she saw was a dark shadow moving past for a moment though. And her ears perked at the sound of some strange chirping...

"But I just hate competition... So good luck!" Chrysalis cooed "And if you fail, well, I'll make sure to send your parts back to little Twilight..."

It seemed the Queen have finished her monologue. Now Celestia's attention was fully on her new adversary. By the sounds of it, the shadowy figure was approaching her. She heard heavy breathing, and heavy steps.

Finally, it revealed itself. The princess' heart skipped a beat, but she pulled it together in a moment. She saw worse, and probably fought worse. But the thing was still a little jarring... Its size rivaled Chrysalis'. Where its face would be, a chitin plate covered everything, as if a helmet. It bared a mouth of sharp fangs at Celestia, while its antennae flailed wildly. It didn't have any wings, but in turn, it had a pair of stumped limbs on its chest.

Oh, and a long, incredibly sharp-looking horn.

The being, lacking eyes, still knew where Celestia was. It let out a piercing screech, and charged at the princess.

But Celestia was ready, and shot her basic combat spell at the monster. She hit it in the face, but it ricocheted off from the face-plate. Celestia, surprised, dodged the charging attack, and the brutish changeling almost hit the wall behind her.

It took a few seconds for the thing to turn back, and seek out the princess. It sniffed the air and stuck out its snake-like tongue. But using the intermission, Celestia now aimed properly, and cast a stronger magic bolt, where the chitin plates met on the creature's side.

To Celestia's even bigger surprise, her spell was absorbed...

"It has magic absorption like an alicorn..."

Celestia started to get a tiny bit concerned, but she also knew that every magical being with that attribute can be overloaded, and then it would die from spells like normal.

The creature charged again, and Celestia used teleportation to get out of the way at the last moment. Now the changeling actually hit a wall, and its horn even got embedded in it.

"Just how sharp that horn is???" Celestia thought, and the next moment, she cast multiple beam spells at the thing. Its body flinched, but these got absorbed too, and got itself free in the meantime.

The two powerful beings faced down each other. Celestia's pure white form against the eyeless, insectoid equine monster. Then suddenly, the latter threw its head back, and let out another screech, along with a shockwave of accumulated magical energy. 

That caught Celestia off-guard, and using her moment of dizziness, the monstrosity went at the princess again. Celestia instinctively pulled her head away just before the razor-edged horn could slice it in half, while extending her forelegs to slow down the impact. She got pushed away, while her rear horseshoes threw sparks against the rocky ground surface.

Eventually, the large alicorn could stop her equally big adversary. Now locked in a bout of wrestling, the being simply tried to overpower Celestia, and sure enough, the princess had to put in all the effort to keep the snapping maw away from her neck.

Seeing tearing out her throat wouldn't work, the creature tried to simply slice Celestia's horn in half. As they locked horns, the being pressed its own against Celestia's, and the soft, fuzzy skin began to peel off. In a panic, Celestia fired off a repulse spell, but that only gave her a second of intermission. The creature continued the process, but now locking their horns together from the other side.

If Celestia lost her horn, her way of focusing magic would be lost too, and this gods-forsaken new hive would become the site of her very last battle. If only she was a bit stronger to overpower this brute...

"That's it!"

Strength-improving spells exist, flashed through Celestia's mind. She remembered how it's done, and cast it on herself in a split-second.

The alicorn felt the energy cursing through first her spine, then the rest of her bones, and finally all her muscles. Feeling like a mountain propelled by every piece of energy in the universe, Celestia pushed back her adversary violently, and it flew back a few good meters.

The monster didn't budge though, but before it could began another visceral attack, Celestia tackled it to the ground. It trashed under her, but the princess managed to turn its body to the side, and pressed down on both its forelegs. Its defenses gone, the alicorn stomped the creature's head. Exploding under her hoof like a mere egg, all that remained were innumerable tiny pieces of chitin, fangs, and some greenish sludge, that the formative exoskeleton contained. And two tiny, underdeveloped eyes...

Celestia stepped off from the monster, and flicked off the goo from her front-right hoof. She looked at her former adversary again, then away with disgust. She then let go of the strength spell. It might've been brutally effective, but it actually put a serious strain on the skeletal system. And fighting like a buffalo or yak wasn't the alicorn way anyway.



Celestia entered the next chamber, and as soon as she did, the door behind her snapped shut. She looked back. She knew what was about to come, and only one ruler would leave the underground place alive. But she was ready.

The princess took a few steps forward. Then, from behind a pillar, her nemesis appeared. With a sadistic smile, Chrysalis started:

"Princess Celestia! You're alive. Then I surmise my would-be successor is dead. I thank you for that. But I can assure you, you won't survive me."

Celestia cocked her head a little bit. She gave the changeling queen an unimpressed look:

"Then let's not stall any longer. Show me what you got."

Chrysalis softly cackled:

"Your overconfidence will be your undoing, princess..."

Then her expression suddenly changed, and shouted madly:

"DIE!!!"

The queen fired a dark-green beam of energy at Celestia, but she dashed away in a wake of magic, ending up right behind one of the pillars that seemingly held up that part of the hive. Chrysalis didn't stall, and seeing her spell didn't hit its mark, fired again, and sliced Celestia's pillar in half. The princess dashed away again, behind another, thicker pillar.

Chrysalis, seeing that, switched spells, and fired high powered magic bolts, beginning to reduce the column of rock piece by piece. But Celestia wasn't fazed by the showcase of arcane masonry, and simply repositioned herself a bit.

"Stop hiding, you coward! Come out, and face me!" the changeling sneered.

Celestia smirked. By a sudden thought, she engaged her cloaking spell, and slipped away from her hiding place. Chrysalis didn't notice, due to the dust the impact of her hits created. She was adamant of making pebbles out of the alicorn's former hiding place.

Less than half a minute later, that inevitably happened. When the dust settled a bit, Chrysalis moved in, with horn lit, to finish her opponent off. But of course, she didn't find her.

Celestia took the opportunity, and sneaked past behind the queen, to the other half of the chamber. When the changeling gave up searching for her, she looked around, with slight confusion on her face.

That was when Celestia called out to her, in a singsong voice:

"Searching for something, Chrysalis? I'm sure if you search harder, you can find iiit!"

The mentioned one traced the voice back to its origin. She fired there, blasting yet another pillar into smithereens.

Celestia wasn't even behind that one. She took a few steps, and talked again, her voice being more serious:

"Let's play a game, Chrysalis! I'll ask you something, and you will give me a fully satisfactory answer, or else I will kill you. You'll have three attempts. Sounds fun to you?"

Chrysalis let out a mad roar, and fired several bolts of magic in the general direction of Celestia's voice, topping it off with a magic missile that exploded on the wall behind Celestia. But she wasn't near enough to get harmed.

"ARGGGH, you have the nerve to make fun of me? When you are THIS close to your demise? You didn't even fire a single shot. Fight me already! Do not delay the inevitable."

Celestia moved behind one of the still intact pillars. Chrysalis noticed the slight refraction her invisible foe created, and fired after her. But she couldn't even tell if she hit anything or not. Celestia wasn't notorious for screaming. She didn't even scream when she made her eat her energy beam at that fateful wedding.

Chrysalis followed Celestia - at least she thought she followed her. When she took the shot after turning the corner, she simply hit another wall opposite of her. She talked again, now with less anger and confidence:

"What would your subjects think that you're hiding like that? Tell me, Celestia!"

Meanwhile, Celestia tiptoed away, and answered:

"Hmmm... What would your subjects think that you can't even hit me? But here comes the question: Where are my royal guards?"

Chrysalis followed the sound, with her horn lit. She was sure she traced the alicorn's steps, and let out a green bolt of magic, but then again, only created some splintered rocks.

"I already told you, they are sucked dry of love, and no, you won't get them back!"

"WRONG ANSWER." Celestia's voice reverberated throughout the chamber "You have two attempts remaining."

Chrysalis was taken aback slightly. But she was still sure she could take on the overconfident pony princess. She walked to the middle of the chamber, where she could see any potential movement. Then she saw it, as if something moved past between the stone constructs holding up the place. She charged up and released quick shots of magic, but hit nothing.

She only heard the cackle of a voice far too soft to her ears.

Then she suddenly heard it from right behind herself. She turned, but her nemesis wasn't there.

Chrysalis shifted her eyes back and forth. She concentrated. Then, she heard Celestia's voice again.

"I'm awaiting your answer."

"You won't get an answer out of me! They..."

Chrysalis' voice slightly hitched. Then she gulped, and continued.

"...they are deep within this hive! Deeper than you'd think! In this new hive, right on Equestria's doorstep! And you can do little to stop me!"

"Bring me to them." Celestia demanded, icy and calm.

"Never!"

Chrysalis then felt the draft of someone moving past her. She jumped away, took flight, turned, and let out a combat spell, but aside from the ground, hit nothing. She returned to the ground. She looked left and right. Celestia was nowhere. Then taking the initiative, she ran behind one of the pillars, but she saw nothing, then tried the next pillar, then the next... To no avail.

"You still owe me an answer, Chrysalis." Celestia's voice echoed. The confused queen really didn't know anymore where the sound came from.

"D-did she ever tell you? Hehe... Cadence, what I did to her when I captured her, and dragged her down to the old mines beneath Canterlot? She begged me to release her, with her hooves put together, and tears in her eyes. And then? Heh... I hit her, as hard as I could, and she fell to the ground. She just remained there, and covered, as I closed her prison, and told her it would become her grave! Heh-hehe... What do you say now, C-celestia? WHAT WILL YOU DO???"

Celestia suddenly decloaked. She was walking right at Chrysalis, with slow, deliberate steps. The queen gasped, and they locked gazes.

"THERE YOU ARE!" she yelled, and madly began firing her strongest spells at her.

Celestia just moved forward with a killer expression. Chrysalis moved back, still firing, but the impacts only created ripples upon Celestia's full-body magical shield. She almost backed into a corner. At that point, she completely lost her nerve. But she couldn't give up. She was the queen of the changelings. She had to prevail. And she still had one chance at victory.

She lit up her horn, channeling all the love energy she gained from the royal guards into her spell. Her horn glowed with a sickly green color, and she broke into mad laughter:

"Here you go Celestia, a "blast from the past", so to say! HAHAHAHA!!!"

Chrysalis released her beam. It was the exact same kind of method that brought the princess down at the wedding. But Celestia countered it with her own, and the two beams met halfway between them.

Celestia had a hard time holding the changeling magic back. Seeing her struggle, Chrysalis regained her confidence, and using the positive emotion, channeled even more energy into her spell. 

But Celestia persevered, and their beams' meeting point began to build up into a ball of energy. Chrysalis concentrated, trying to move the ball towards Celestia, but she was already past her abilities.

Sweating, but not letting go, Celestia muttered the words:

"Now you will see... what would have happened... if there was nopony around!"

And she smiled. And something dawned on Chrysalis, that she was had, and that this entire battle was being built up to this moment. She struggled, but couldn't let go, because that would have meant death for her. But the ball of energy just grew in size, and was close to critical mass.

The gold and green magics swirled around each other in the sphere, but couldn't stay in the same space and violently erupted. The explosion threw the changeling queen into the wall behind her, and washed over Celestia, who remained unharmed due to her shield. The chamber's remaining pillars collapsed, and the ceiling fell down in many places.

Celestia opened her eyes, and looked around. Then her gaze remained on the crumpled pile of chitin in front of her, Chrysalis. She walked up to her, and turned her around. Although grievously injured, she was still alive. And looking at her pathetic form, the previously enraged Celestia had a change of heart...

"You are beaten." the alicorn began "Let's not continue this struggle, and I mean this for the future as well. Steer clear of Equestria and ponykind, and I will spare you, and your subjects. What do you say, queen of the changelings?"

The queen looked up at the talker. Goo was dripping from her mouth, and from a wound on her head. She wheezed:

"You came to me... and defeated me on my own turf. When my subjects learn of this" she coughed "I will lose all authority. I will no longer be looked upon as their rightful queen. Might makes..."

Chrysalis struggled. Her breathing became sporadic.

"Might makes right in our society. Always did. So what rights I have left? Just finish what you have started, Heavenly Daemon. Have your revenge..."

Celestia's expression became softer. She sighed:

"And can't that change? Can't you become better than those who came before you? Ponykind could change me. Because I let myself become better for their sake. So I wouldn't make the same mistakes my ancestors have made."

"No. NO!" Chrysalis interrupted, with all the strength she had left "My civilization always preyed upon other races, for survival. Their feelings meant our prosperity. What could I change? There is no other way. If you let me out of here, and I don't get banished, I will lead my subjects and attack Equestria again, until I don't succeed. So just end this. Shoot."

Celestia frowned. Her horn lit up, and charged up a spell.

Then closed the wound on Chrysalis' head.

"Look. If you will attack again, I will fight you again. But I won't strike down a beaten foe. I won't be like my tribe was. I'm giving you a chance. Now give yourself a chance, too. So please, lead me to my subjects. And I will no longer hold this conflict against you."

Chrysalis looked upon Celestia, unsure, hesitating. Some seconds later though, her horn flickered, but managed to cast, and dispelled some illusion spell that hid a door.

"There." she pointed, with a shaking hoof "They are behind that door. All four of them."

Celestia nodded, and made her way to the door. After it opened, she illuminated the dark room, and to her great relief, no further trickery or ambush awaited her. She saw her guards, indeed all four of them, hanging from the ceiling, each in a separate cocoon. 

Meanwhile, Chrysalis struggled to her hooves. Celestia looked back, and the queen already made it to the exit, albeit with wobbly steps. She looked back too.

"Never underestimate us, princess. Because if I ever get the chance you got here today, I surely won't hesitate. Remember this."

She coughed, and exited the chamber that was the site of their battle. Celestia let out a long sigh, and began to free her guards.



After Celestia finished restoring the spirits of her guards, she herself felt a little... empty. But she thought it was nothing a hug from her sister Luna wouldn't fix! After a little rest, she urged her guards to leave. Not because the hive was still dangerous, but simply because the place started to disgust even Celestia. Those cocoons she have broken open still lay at her feet, after all. But the Lieutenant had something to say:

"Princess. Thank you for coming after and saving us. I really don't know how to express my gratitude. And... I'm really ashamed you had to protect us. It should be the other way around, always."

The other guards nodded in agreement. But Celestia just let out a chuckle, and answered:

"So you're saying it's me who should always get into trouble? My good Lieutenant, I know you've made an oath to always protect me and my subjects, under all circumstances, but I've also made a similar oath when I was coronated. So be ashamed of nothing, really."

"In that case, I'm really glad, and let me thank you again. But considering we're still in this Tartarus-forsaken hive, let me ask: Is it safe to move out? What's the status of the enemy forces in the area?"

Celestia raised an eyebrow and smirked:

"To put it in your terms, Lieutenant: All hostiles have been eliminated."

"And what about that evil monster Chrysalis? Is she dead, too?" another guard asked.

"I'm afraid..." Celestia started, and looked to the ground "She has gotten away."

"I have given her a chance..."

"Oh well," replied yet another guard "You still did well, princess! All hail Princess Celestia, the royal hero! You should really get a medal for all of that, you know?"

"Oh, I'll make sure Luna gives me one!" Celestia said, in a deliberately silly tone "But let's get out of here now, shall we? After all, we might just miss a beautiful sunset."


THE END

It was a glorious day in Ponyville. Birds chirped in a sing-song like matter, shops were busy with costumers, and all types of ponies busily trotted around town, eager to either meet another pony or get to a shop before it got too crowded. Everypony, that is except for Twilight Sparkle and Spike, who had just (at last) finished sorting the library all the way from top to bottom, left to right, A to Z and so on... Both unicorn and dragon were exhausted, puffing and panting after their day of exertion. Today they had unshelved and reshelved the entire library; the whole process had taken all night. Being only a baby dragon, Spike groaned loudly, only capable of a murmur, “Ughhh... I'm going to bed Twi...”
Twilight answered with a soft yawn mid-sentence, “You do that, Spike… at least it’s done now. We don’t have to do this now for at least another year... I'm going to go for a walk, catch up with the girls before I call it in. I’ll lock the door behind me so you don’t have to worry about any pony breaking in...” As Twilight had said that, Spike was already halfway up the stairs and slowly falling asleep as he went. Twilight waved goodbye to Spike before shutting the door behind her and locking it.
At this point in time, Twilight had numerous bags under her eye and unfortunately for her, the first pony she happened to run into was a somewhat deflated Pinkie Pie. Pinkie at this time of the morning would usually wake Twilight up with smells of frosting's and flour, and with a kaleidoscope of confetti shot directly into her face, but not today. Today, Pinkie was sitting at a bench staring at an apple, watching the busy market and seemingly deep in thought. This was not usual Pinkie behaviour (although what qualified as ‘usual Pinkie behaviour’ was subject to question), and this worried Twilight. She decided to go and see if Pinkie was alright, but as she got closer Pinkie became visibly agitated by Twilight’s presence; even more so when she called her name to see if she was ok.
“Twilight?” Pinkie asked in a very nervous tone, shaking a little, the purple unicorn raising her ears as she heard Pinkie respond. Cautiously, Twilight sat down next to Pinkie and asked in a rather deadpan tone.
"Pinkie Pie, what's wrong?" The pink mare looked nervously at the apple. Twilight's first impression of the apple was that it looked like no apple she had ever seen before ... While yes it smelt like just another apple from Sweet Apple Acres, it looked almost like one of Applejack's Zap-Apples, but if all the colours were inverted. Odd, Zap-Apples were not due for another 3 months. Experimentally, Twilight levitated the apple a little closer to herself. Just as she did so however, Pinkie shot her a sinister glare, almost as if silently willing her not to proceed with just her gaze.
"Twilight, don't... For the love of Celestia and Luna, don't eat that apple." The pink mare warned, putting more emphasis on the last bit of that sentence. Twilight however was enraptured by the apple to the point where she basically ignored her pink friend. No harm in some experimentation. She took a bite. The texture of the apple was… weird… to Twilight as well. It kind of felt like the apple was made of mush, with slight tastes of mangos, bananas and oddly enough, vanilla. Almost immediately, her vision began to spin, twisting and turning, almost as if she was trapped in a giant sphere and the world was made of rainbows and jelly.
"Pinkie, please take me home..." She added in a panic, trying to reach out to her friend.
***
It had taken Pinkie a lot longer than she would have liked to get her lavender friend home. This was largely because she was frequently consumed with sobbing, and partly because anytime she had tried to move Twilight safely, the unicorn would involuntarily twist and contort in a multitude of strange ways. Currently, she was stuck with her head under her stomach, her tail somehow wrapped around her throat, severely restricting her breathing. Even though she was only a few paces from Twilight's tree house library, it still took her some time to reach the door itself. Once she finally had her inside the house, she placed Twilight on the couch before collapsing onto her haunches and letting out a series of soft sobs for her friend (whose head was thankfully the right way, or as ‘right way’ as one can be while laying on a couch). As she started to sob, she heard a familiar belch-like sound. Curious, she looked up at the stairs and saw the last remains or a brilliant green flame, followed by a loud shout from upstairs, “Twilight!”
Pinkamena was startled by the loud shout before the baby dragon came bolting down the stairs, heading her way. Before he could reach Twilight, the earth pony placed her hoof in his path, cutting him off from Twilight. She let out a soft sigh and tried to explain, “Spike, don't interrupt Twilight, she’s taken a bite out of a cursed Zap-Apple. Any sudden jerks could sen...”
Before she could even finish her sentence, the baby dragon had pushed her hoof from his path and had continued to attempt to get Twilight's attention. Without much reasoning or thought behind the action, he started to shake the almost paralysed unicorn. Pinkamena noticed this, and quickly threw him away from Twilight, trying to protect her from the damage the little dragon was inadvertently doing, “Stop! Please, Spike, just… just stop.”
Rather unfortunately, it just so happened that Applejack had come to visit Twilight regarding… concerning matters… and saw Pinkie tossing Spike across the room. Applejack briefly saw red, strutting up to Pinkamena and asking her in a passive-aggressive tone, “What in tarnation has gotten into ya'll Pinkie? Ya can't be throwing others around like they’re rag-dolls sugarcube...”
Confused and a little bit startled to see the angry southern workhorse behind her, Pinkamena stammered anxiously, “Oh, A-A-Applejack, I-I... I didn't see you there; there’s more to this than what meets the eye, um… T-T-Twilight ate that cursed Zap-Apple and she just started… twisting and contorting unlike anything I have ever seen before! I only just managed to get her here before Spike got er... Got er...” For a moment, Pinkamena's mind was blank as she felt a hard lump form in her throat, preventing her from speaking. With a few deep breaths, she was able to swallow and continue with a more measured approach. “... Got a letter of some kind, and when he tried to get her attention, I had to stop him! He could have hurt her! But… but while I... I…” It was at this moment she felt her eyes begin to burn as if on fire as, as she tried her best not to cry. Unfortunately for her, it wasn’t long before she couldn’t keep back the tears any longer, and let the water works begin to flow with the accompanying sobs as she tried to finish what she was telling Applejack. “... I was explaining things to him, he... He slipped away from my hoof and got to her and started shaking her and... Well, you saw the rest...”

Flurry Heart slammed her horn against the iron frame of the bed. Tears sprang from her eyes as she wailed in pain. Still, she persisted, bringing her horn down again and again. The ring around her horn remained stubbornly fixed as she pantomimed trying to remove it.

The old dog barked something in that brutal tongue of the griffons, waving his paws in a gesture that might have been comforting if it had not come from a slab of meat thrice her size.

“I don’t speak your stupid language,” Flurry scolded through her tears. “Prench, idiot, or Aquileian, I don’t care which.”

The dog huffed and let his paws dangle uselessly by his sides. His uniform was surprisingly plain, a simple brown jacket and pants, with a ceremonial sword on one hip and a holster on the other. Flurry still wore her frilled pink dress with a high white collar, although her tiara had been left behind in her bedchambers.

Aquileia was a strange place, the only griffon-held area where ponies and griffons lived together in relative harmony. Flurry had heard stories that the eastern borderlands were consumed in fire and blood between the races, but the Aquileian monarchs had always protected their Pony subjects. Even when the Revolution came, it was not divided by race; Ponies and Griffons marched and fought together against their brothers and sisters.

Aquileia had been a kingdom, a vassal of the Griffonian Reich, a republic, a restored kingdom, then finally a second republic. The Republicans had made the change stick by beheading King Discret early and exiling his daughter Vivienne east. Flurry liked to imagine that Vivienne and her Aunties sat around the same table in the River Republic to the east, grumbling over their rights and titles.

The Republicans had been wary of her father when he crossed from New Mareland to offer his services in their army. They had an innate distrust of monarchs, even princes without a princedom. Shining Armor had persisted, swearing to uphold the ideals of the Republic and renouncing his claim to the Crystal Empire and Equestria. Flurry had been appalled.

“How could you?” she railed at him when she had caught the announcement over the radio; the Republicans were using it as propaganda. “Mom believed in the Empire with all her heart. The Crystal Ponies believed in you! What will they think when they hear this? When we go back to the Empire-”

“We won’t go back,” Shining Armor said, adjusting the buttons on his blue dress shirt. He had been made a Lieutenant. It was a disgrace; her father had commanded the entire army of the Crystal Empire, millions of ponies, and the Republicans had given him the rank of Lieutenant.

“Auntie Celestia and Luna are rebuilding the fleet in New Mareland. They’ve announced an alliance of free nations.”

“With who?” Shining had asked.

“The radio didn’t say,” Flurry replied.

“Because there is no alliance. There is no one left to appeal to.” Shining knelt before his daughter to look her in the eyes. His own eyes were sunken and eternally bloodshot. He had aged a decade in half the time. His blue mane had a few streaks of white had matched his coat.

“Flurry,” he began, “New Mareland doesn’t have the Ponies to retake Equestria. It doesn’t have the ships and it doesn’t have the equipment. Everypony and everygriffon know it.”

“You could help them,” Flurry tried.

“I won’t help them fight a doomed war,” her father dismissed. “Not after they left Twilight. New Mareland only existed on Griffonia with Equestria’s help.”

Her father seemed prophetic when New Mareland was invaded by Wingbardy three months later, ostensibly to reclaim long-lost territory. Celestia and Luna’s grand army to reclaim Equestria crumbled in two weeks. The Sisters fled on a convoy east, given shelter by the River Coalition. No army followed them.

As far as anyone was concerned, Flurry Heart was the last serious Princess of Ponies at the age of nine. She had been afraid that the Aquileians would view her unkindly; the streets of Aquileia were cluttered with posters reminding its citizens of the cruelty of their monarchs and how they oppressed their griffons and ponies alike. They had not asked her to renounce her crown, nor would she, even if her father urged her. Flurry Heart had a duty to everypony, and she would see that duty through to the end.

Like her mother.

Instead, the opposite occurred. Aquileans were a romantic people, much like the Crystal Ponies. Flurry became the Lost Princess and a minor celebrity, and her father’s devotion to his family and the Republic was celebrated with a promotion to Colonel. Shining Armor didn’t cry.

Her father had wept when he heard that Cadance was staying behind with the Crystal Heart during the retreat. He had been in a field command tent in Rainbow Falls, trying to coordinate desperate pockets of resistance against Changeling panzers. He ran out of tears by the time he heard that Twilight stayed in Canterlot while Auntie Celestia and Luna retreated. He had formed a shield over the Sisters one night in Manehatten, screaming at them. Flurry and the soldiers couldn't hear what he said through the spell.

It was the last time her father ever spoke to her aunts. He never said, but Flurry knew even at seven years old that he only left with the other Princesses to keep her safe. 

Flurry was still surprised when he woke her up early one morning in their New Mareland apartment and took her across the short channel to the Aquileian Republic. She was barely awake when she met a nice griffon girl in front of some cameras and shook her claw. 

She didn’t realize it was the President of the Republic until after breakfast. 

Flurry had been assigned a tutor to learn Aquileian, a young black griffon that had cringed at her Prench accent. Luckily for him, Flurry had learned quickly. Unluckily, he also had to tutor Shining Armor, who still kept his Prench accent despite his best efforts.

It had been a quiet life compared to New Mareland. Aquileian style hid her oversized wings in a poofy dress when she went out with her father, and her friends, cubs and foals of Shining’s new officers, complained that Flurry was too nice to be the evil queen in Tyrants and Revolutionaries. Aquileia fought a few short wars with its neighbors, then announced an alliance with the Griffonian Republic and the Skyfall Trade Federation. Flurry Heart looked at her father’s map when she was nine and asked him what was happening.

“Aquileia is getting some friends to stand up to the Griffonian Reich,” Shining said, gesturing to the center of the map with a quill. “With the Republic in the north and Skyfall controlling the ocean, Aquileia is to the south. The Reich is trapped. They have to fight everywhere.”

“Why are they fighting?”

“You remember all the Grovers,” Shining sighed, “or else I have to hunt down Sunburst.”

“I remember!” Flurry lied, “Grover One used his guns. Grover Two beat you black and blue. Grover Three made fees. Grover Four ate more. Grover Five is alive!”

“Rhyme’s out of date,” Shining chuckled, “Grover the Fifth died several years ago. His son, Grover the Sixth, is about your age.”

Flurry stuck out her tongue. “Is he nice?”

Shining paused, tapping a hoof on the floor. “We never met him. Equestria always disagreed with the Reich about war. His regent is in charge, like Sunburst, but far stricter and meaner.”

“So, he has to do what the regent says?”

“At his age, yes,” Shining swept the quill up and down half the continent, “The Reich used to control everything. Right after I was born, there was a big war and everygriffon decided to split up. The regent says they’re going to take everything back.”

Flurry stared at the map for a long time, squinting. The Griffonian Reich would be the size of Equestria if it controlled that much stuff. She shifted her focus to Equestria, drawn in black to represent its occupation by the Changelings.

“Dad?”

“Yes, Flurry?”

“You’re gonna stop them, right?”

“I’m going to try, Flurry,” He would have said ‘yes’, a few years ago.

Shining Armor tried. He was put in charge of a critical holding point in the frontline when the war finally broke out. He didn’t hug her goodbye, nor did he promise to return. Flurry caught enough snippets on the radio from the basement to know it wasn’t going well, but she didn’t tell the other foals. The north had been pushed back, and the navy was doing well but out of fuel. 

One day, there was gunfire outside and the adults left with their guns and didn’t come back. Flurry stayed with three of her friends, technically in charge because she was oldest and a Princess. They ran out of food after four days, and Flurry decided that she needed to go check if the neighbors had any left. The gunfire was very loud, but had moved several streets away. Flurry guessed that the fighting was mostly over. Flurry put on her frilly dress and left her crown behind.

Flurry Heart walked over several bodies in the street while she was looking for food. She had seen dead ponies before, during the retreat from the Empire despite Sunburst’s best efforts, but the Griffons were new. She spared them a cursory glance before closing their eyes with magic. She didn’t recognize any of them.

Flurry ran into a group of Griffon soldiers in unfamiliar gray uniforms on the way back. She actually passed by them without issue until one of her saddlebags slipped off her wing. One soldier took notice and shouted a challenge, then looked jubilant when Flurry turned around and stared at him.

He was young with golden feathers and babbled excitedly as he approached, speaking the language of the Griffonian heartland. Flurry never learned it, but recognized her name being spoken several times. Flurry waited until the griffon got close, then summoned a bright blue shield around herself.

“I have to get this back to my friends, sorry,” she said in Aquileian.

The soldier looked confused at the shield while some of his friends laughed at him. After a moment, he tapped on the shield with a claw.

Flurry shook her head and walked away, taking the shield with her.

The soldier pounded on the shield with the butt of his rifle.

“Hey!” Flurry shouted, “Don’t do that, it makes my horn hurt.” She turned away again and continued down the street.

There was a gunshot and Flurry’s horn itched. She sighed and turned around as the Griffon lowered his rifle, glaring at Flurry. His friends stumbled up behind him shouting angrily, not at Flurry, but at him. He sneered something over his beak back at them before working the bolt on his rifle.

Flurry dropped the shield, seized his rifle with her magic, ejected the clip, and disassembled the rifle like her father showed her. 

She blinked and let the parts fall to the ground. One of the other griffons, an older male with a graying head, stepped forward.

“Princess Flurry Heart?” he asked in heavily-accented Aquileian.

“Yes,” Flurry replied as she brought her shield back up and began to walk away. He followed at a respectful distance.

“The battle is over. Could you come with us, please?”

“No, I have stuff for my friends.”

The griffon looked thoughtful. “Food?”

“Yes.”

“You have much food?”

Flurry eyed her meager bags. It wasn’t even enough for her. “No,” she replied.

“If we give you food, will you come with us?”

“Are you asking if I will surrender if you help my friends?” Flurry sighed.

The griffon stopped walking after her, either surprised or needing a moment to parse her words.

“You are not a prisoner,” he flapped his wings to catch up.

That was a lie, and Flurry felt stupid for not realizing it at the time. She soon found herself with an inhibitor ring on her horn and stuffed inside an unused bedroom in occupied Aquileia.

At least my friends got some rations, Flurry thought. The old brown dog had been waiting in the bedroom and seemed content to let Flurry wander around, talking idly in his language while Flurry spoke Aquileian back. After several hours, Flurry began to ram her horn against the bedframe. She could have melted the ring off, but Flurry risked taking half the building with it. She had no idea where she'd go even if she escaped. The old dog gave up trying to talk to her just as a pair of Griffon knights entered the room and spoke to him. The dog waved at Flurry to follow him.

Flurry was led by the knights and dog into the courtyard outside Parliament. Once, it was the royal palace of the Discrets; the republicans had turned the building into their Parliamentary chambers. Judging from the banners haphazardly dangling from the balconies, it was back to being a seat of royalty. The banners were yellow and orange, depicting a proud griffon in black relief- the symbol of the Griffonian Reich.

Before the doors to the central chamber, the knight in shining plate armor and a blue plume whirled around and faced Flurry. Placing his claws flush against the ground, he spread his wings and raised his beak to the sky, proclaiming a grand stream of unintelligible garble.

The old dog behind her laughed, and the griffon scowled under his helmet. They exchanged some harsh words before the griffon’s wings deflated and he cast an embarrassed glance at Flurry before waving at the griffons standing before the doors. They pushed them open and the guards ushered Flurry through. There were armed guards throughout the Parliamentary chamber, spread out along the walls and standing between the scattered desks. All of them cast wary stares at the alicorn.

Flurry blinked at the young griffon wearing an impractically heavy crown. He was seated in the Speaker’s chair, wearing a simple white dress shirt and blue slacks with a small set of spectacles resting awkwardly on his beak. If not for the emerald and ruby studded crown, Flurry would have dismissed him as a high school student. The griffon blinked back at her, then adjusted his oversized crown. An absolutely ancient griffon in red and white priestly robes stood beside him and waved a shaking claw at a purple Aquileian pony.

“Princess Flurry Heart of the Crystal Empire and Equestria,” the pony began in Aquileian, “you stand before Kaiser Grover VI of the Griffonian Reich, rightful heir to Aquileia, Wingbardy, the Borderlands and the North.”

They kept my titles, Flurry thought. She spread out her wings and bent her forelegs in a sweeping bow. “I greet you humbly and beg for your mercy, Kaiser,” Flurry replied in Aquileian. The pony spoke to the Kaiser in Herzlander, the Kaiser’s brutal native tongue. The Kaiser replied back as soon as the pony finished, and the flustered pony translated to Flurry.

“There is no need to beg, Princess. The Kaiser has sworn you shall not be harmed.” 

“Then I beg for the lives of all Aquileians, Kaiser. They are a kind and just people, but my friends hide from your army, hungry and without their parents. I feared they would cast my father and I aside due to our crowns, but they embraced us as family.”

The pony translated, and this time the old griffon replied.

“The Kaiser has no desire to harm his subjects, as misguided as they may be. The Kaiser promises that your friends will be fed. He also wishes your father to surrender, and pledges that he will not be harmed,” the Pony translated.

Flurry closed her eyes, “My father is dead.”

The young griffon appeared confused before the Pony translated. He asked the old priest beside him, and they conversed in whispers for a moment. The old griffon spoke and the pony translated.

“The Kaiser encourages you to have hope. Colonel Shining Armor is a fierce fighter, and has given the Kaiser’s army much trouble.”

“That’s why I know he’s dead,” Flurry replied, staring at the small griffon. “If he were alive, you would not be in that chair.”

The Kaiser’s wings twitched and he lowered his beak. The old griffon beside him was far better at masking his emotions. The pony looked between the Princess and the Kaiser for a moment.

“Translate it,” Flurry demanded.

The pony stuttered, but spoke to the Kaiser in Herzlander with her head held low and forelegs bent in supplication. The old griffon began to reply harshly, but the Kaiser’s head snapped up and he issued a sharp rebuke to the priest. The griffon’s eyebrows wrinkled further, but he instead turned and called to the guards against the door. He spoke quickly to the pony.

“The Kaiser and his regent, Archon Eros VII, share your grief, Princess Flurry. The Kaiser’s father was also taken far too soon from this world by Boreas. The Kaiser still encourages you to have hope, for his esteemed friends in the Changeling Queendom bring wonderful news.” The Aquileian pony’s mouth had twisted during the spiel, unable to keep a straight face.

Flurry Heart turned around as the doors opened again and two Changelings swaggered in. There was really no other word for it, Flurry thought. The one in the lead bore a fez and a chest of medals on a crisp uniform that had never seen a day of combat. The other, lagging behind with a slight limp, tracked mud onto the red carpeting. His uniform was rumpled, with only three medals hanging askew on his chest.

The fez-wearing changeling offered Flurry an easy smirk, purple eyes smiling with delight. 

“Greetings, Flurry Heart. I am Field Marshal Synoval with the Changeling embassy to the great Griffonian Reich,” he stated in Equestrian. He buzzed a wing towards his partner. “This is General Thranx, fresh from the frontlines. We are very pleased to meet you.” Thranx offered a brief nod, but did not make eye contact.

Flurry took a slow breath through her nose, resisting the urge to paw at the ground with her hoof. 

“I wish I could share your enthusiasm,” she lied in Equestrian.

Synoval obviously caught her lie, but lowered his head in sorrow anyway. 

“We are sorry to hear about your father. He was a great opponent in the Righteous War against Equestria; the Queen was eager to see him again.”

“I’m sure she was,” Flurry replied noncommittally. She stilled her twitching wings.

Synoval took Flurry’s attitude in stride. 

“Queen Chrysalis, in her magnanimous mercy, even allowed your dearest mother, Mi Amore Cadenza, to travel here to urge your father’s surrender. We make an offer to you, Flurry Heart. You may travel together back to the Crystal City and share your grief.” Synoval removed his fez with a flash of his horn. “As a family,” he added.

Cadance appeared in the doorway, surrounded by a squad of Jaegers, the elite Changeling troops. The old dog stood behind Cadance, shuffling his paws.

Flurry Heart remembered her mother standing before the Crystal Heart, clad in specially-made purple barding, enchanted to resist high-caliber small arms fire. She would have made an impressive figure if her eyes weren’t so sunken and hollow as she stared at the glowing Heart.

My family or my throne. Love is the death of duty, Flurry. I will always love you, but I cannot leave them, not again, not after so much loss.

Flurry had been too young to understand. She had cried incessantly on the long journey east to Manehatten, traveling at night to avoid Changeling bombing runs. When her father finally boarded the last convoy to depart, she clung to his legs with all her strength. 

He cried too, but for Twilight as well.

Flurry seized a hold of that memory as she faced this Cadance, who was too clean, too trim. Her purple and gold mane was done up in the old, poofy style that Cadance had abandoned after long nights at her desk; her wings were preened with no feather out of place. Her horn had a simple black ring at the base, the same as Flurry. 

This Cadance wore no regalia, only a simple purple dress. A lone tear emerged from her right eye as she strode towards her daughter. “Oh, my Little Wings,” she began, using the ironic nickname her mother had sparingly used in private, “I’ve missed you so much. My heart broke a thousand times a day.”

“She was so miserable that a Changeling couldn’t bear to get near her,” Synoval added from her side. The other Changeling, Thranx, wouldn’t make eye contact with Flurry and backed out of the way.

Flurry gripped the memory tighter in her mind. “Dad’s gone,” she rasped with fresh, snotty tears.

Cadance allowed another solitary tear to slide down her muzzle. 

“I should have been here with Shining. He would have never gone to fight if we were together again.” She stopped a few hooves from Flurry and looked down at her daughter, “I could see his shield blocking the Griffon tanks from the harbor. Aquileia did not deserve him.”

Flurry looked at the gas-masked Jaegers around Cadance, who stared back impassively. 

“We thought you were dead.”

“Sometimes I wished I was,” Cadance responded. “Queen Chrysalis wanted to study the Heart, and needed my cooperation.” She gave a somewhat baleful glance to the Jaeger on her right. “I remind myself that it would be worse for our Ponies if I refused.”

That actually sounded almost like her mother. Flurry stepped forward on trembling hooves, pawing at the carpet. Summoning her most desperate voice, she asked, “C-can we go home now, Mom?”

“Of course, Little Wings,” Cadance gasped as another tear slid down her muzzle.

Flurry rushed forward and embraced her mother. The last hug had been muffled by plate armor and hard steel. It was uncomfortable. Flurry wrapped her wings around Cadance’s forelegs as she lent fully into her chest, smearing her snot into the dress. Flurry tucked her head under Cadance’s chin. Cadance was warm and soft.

This hug was almost perfect.

Flurry’s horn had an inhibitor ring around the base, but the tip was still sharp. When she was bored, Flurry would sweep her old drawings into the air with her wings and spear the paper on her horn in one movement. Her father had caught her once; it was one of the rare moments where he truly laughed.

Flurry leaned down, sniffling, then drove her horn up into Cadance’s neck.

Cadance shifted at the last moment, so the horn instead rammed through the bottom of her jaw. Flurry felt a hot wash of blood splash across her curls and run down her horn as she smiled. The room devolved into screams in Herzlander. Cadance gurgled a command to the Jaegers in the same language, but Flurry’s wings held Cadance’s forelegs in place long enough for Flurry to get one good twist in before stars exploded across her vision as a rifle butt smashed her head away.

By the time Flurry shook her vision clear, she realized that the figure straddling her was the old dog, who had drawn his very sharp, not-at-all ceremonial sword and was hacking apart a Changeling Jaeger lying next to her.

Cadance had torn off a sleeve of her dress and shoved it against her muzzle with magic. Cadance’s green-tinged magic was seemingly not hampered by the supposed ring on her horn. She glared venomously at Flurry with green eyes and batted away the horrified Field Marshal with a hoof. The other general in the muddy uniform stood against a desk, looking bored and miserable. Some of the Griffon Knights were fighting with the other Jaegers at the entrance. Flurry leaned her head back against the ground to get an upside-down look at the young Kaiser and his regent.

The young griffon had discarded his crown and was crouched behind the desk. The old regent was behind him, squawking an order at a Griffon knight. The kaiser and the princess made eye contact; his glasses were askew on his beak.

Flurry grinned at him, tasting blood in her mouth. There was a good chance it wasn’t hers.

The Kaiser’s gold eyes widened, then he steeled himself and leaped onto the desk, screeching some command in a high, reedy voice.

Surprisingly, the violence stopped. The old dog remained standing over Flurry, but stopped hacking at the Jaeger, who slowly crawled towards Cadance and the other Changelings. Field Marshal Synoval, whose fez rested at an angle now, began a long-winded tirade, pointing a hole-ridden hoof at the dog and Flurry the whole time. Flurry assumed it to be about her, but the dog seemed braced for violence and his back paws twitched several times throughout the speech.

The Kaiser cut the Changeling off midway through at some point, which further enraged Cadance, who spat out green, bloody phlegm and mumbled some warning. The old priest, Archon Eros, waved a shaking claw again and again at Cadance, pleading something and speaking softly.

Flurry watched the exchange from her back, glancing back and forth between the Changelings and Griffons and resolving to learn Herzlander. The Kaiser gave her one last glance before speaking to the old priest, who sighed and bowed his head towards the Changelings.

The Changelings looked more enraged than mollified, but Cadance stormed out of the room, hobbling on three legs while she clenched the rags to her muzzle. Field Marshal Synoval and the Jaegers followed, pausing only to drag the wounded one out. He left a blood trail on the carpet. 

When the doors slammed shut in a burst of green magic, General Thranx, the muddy changeling seemingly left behind, slumped down against the desk and laughed. The old dog atop Flurry laughed with him after a beat. The dog looked down at Flurry with kind brown eyes, sheathed his bloody sword and offered a paw to help her up. Flurry accepted it, and stumbled back to her hooves.

The dog looked around the room before pointing at one of the delegate desks and barking. The Aquileian pony, a mare, poked her horn out from behind the desk and looked embarrassed. She blinked when the Kaiser addressed her, then turned to Flurry.

“The Kaiser will speak privately with you, Princess Flurry. Please follow Benito.”

The dog clapped a meaty paw on her wing.
> Part Two
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flurry followed the dog, Benito, out a side door, then through several hallways and workrooms. The Griffon guard presence increased exponentially in this side of the Royal Palace; Flurry guessed they were in the West Wing. After several minutes of walking, Flurry realized they were traveling through the same hallways multiple times, turning sharply at intersections guarded by knights. The dog finally stopped at a plain, unguarded wooden door and rapidly ushered Flurry in.

It was a storage room for cleaning staff. Metal shelves lined the walls, packed with towels, cleaning spray, and some spare uniforms. Benito shut the only door behind her and stood to the side of it against one of the shelves. There was only one bulb to light the room, which left it gloomy. He drew the saber again, placing it on the shelf next to him, and unholstered his pistol. There were no windows and one exit. He looked the shelves over for a moment before giving Flurry a critical look. He pointed at some towels on the shelf beside him.

Flurry took the hint and pulled down some towels with her hooves. She flapped her wings and pulled down a jug of water on one of the higher shelves, popping it open with her teeth and pouring it over her head, soaking her bloody curls and ignored how the frills on her dress collar collapsed. After a few moments of rapidly scrubbing at her mane and bumping against the inhibitor ring, she spoke up.

“You know,” she began in Aquileian, knowing Benito couldn’t understand her, “this would be easier without the ring.”

“I forget,” the dog replied. “Come,” he beckoned his unarmed paw at her.

Flurry blinked, “You know Aquileian?”

“Some. I sit with Kaiser during teach,” Benito raised his muzzle up. “Kaiser know much Aquileian.”

“I thought so,” Flurry replied.

“How?”

“He responded too quickly during the talks,” Flurry said, but Benito’s muzzle twisted and he shrugged at her. “Kaiser talk too fast,” she simplified.

“Not good,” Benito frowned, “Changelings will know.”

“I thought the Changelings are your friends.”

“Only Thranx,” Benito said gravely, then raised a brow at her. “How old is pony?” he asked.

“Ten.”

“Kaiser ten,” Benito chuckled, "and much smart too."

When Flurry approached, he grabbed the ring around her horn and twisted it clockwise and counterclockwise several times. “Dog make ring,” he said while he worked, “Ring hurt pony, use Pony magic to hurt pony. Trick to turn ring off.” He pulled the ring off her horn smoothly.

“Like breaking into a safe,” Flurry replied, sparking her horn. She took a deep breath and felt the magic all around her. As the only natural-born Alicorn in recorded history, scholars had been clambering around Flurry her entire life to study her magic. Her mother had vocally told off any that approached the family, and Sunburst never pressured her to learn magic, not after the troubles of her early foalhood. Her father had been more active, throwing one unicorn that broke into the Crystal Palace in jail and having Aunt Twilight revoke his credentials. Nopony tried to investigate after that, though the war had everyone occupied. 

All Alicorns had a domain, something that spoke to them uniquely over everything else. Cadance could sense love and relationships, something that she used to empower the Crystal Heart and frequently mock Chrysalis over the radio, pointing out that Changeling prisoners of war never felt true love for their Queen, only fear. Auntie Twilight had friendship, both familial and forged in war and adversity. Celestia had the sun and light, and her sister Luna had dreams and the moon. Flurry always told anypony who asked that she wasn’t sure yet, even her father.

When she looked at Benito’s pistol, she could tell it had been fired, not in anger, but in duty. It had killed, she sensed, and will kill again for the Kaiser. She saw magic drift from the blood on the sword resting on the shelf, as new blood covered old stains. Benito favored the sword; it was part of his heritage. Flurry knew that the dogs of the Griffonian Empire held fierce loyalty to the Kaiser, and she felt the loyalty of generations in the blade. The blood told her another story.

“You killed the Changeling that hit me,” she said, looking away from the sword.

Benito glanced at the sword. “No,” he replied. “Bug leave with others. Strong armor,” he laughed.

“He’ll die tonight.”

Benito looked confused, but a rapid-fire knock at the door cut off any reply. He tensed and grabbed the sword with his other paw and leveled the pistol against the door. Flurry stepped back and leaned against the shelf on the opposite side of the closet. The knock repeated in a pattern three times before Benito sighed and knocked back with the butt of his pistol.

The Kaiser entered with the old priest. The old priest took a moment to smooth his red and white plain robe, while the Kaiser still lacked his crown; his dress shirt was untucked from his slacks and rumpled, but his small glasses had been straightened. Flurry realized she was already taller than him when he stopped a just a few hooves away.

Two knights stood in the hallway, and they would have entered, but the closet was already too cramped. Flurry backed up against the back shelf, scrunching her tail and dress as the elderly griffon squeezed past Benito and shuffled next to the Kaiser. Flurry lit her horn and provided a proper ball of light to illuminate the room as Benito shut the door. The old priest flinched and said something to Benito, who responded defensively with crossed paws.

“It is fine,” the young Kaiser replied, looking Flurry over with a blush around his eyes. Flurry’s mane hung loosely around her head, still wet.

“I only know some Aquileian," Grover began with a slight accent. "I learn all the languages of my subjects. I do not know Equestrian.”

“That is fine,” Flurry nodded. Her own Aquileian was better.

“I am Grover-”

“He is Kaiser Grover VI of the Griffonian Reich,” the priest cut him off in heavily accented Aquileian, “rightful heir to the lands of Aquileia, Wingbardy, Cloudberry, Vedina, and the Evi Valley.” Kaiser Grover gave him a look.

“I am Grover,” the Kaiser sighed. “And this is my regent, Archon Eros.”

“My name is Flurry,” the Princess said. “Why am I in a closet?”

“The Changelings wish you harm.”

Flurry snorted, “Is that meant to be a surprise?”

“You attacked your mother,” Eros stated.

“My mother,” Flurry began, “is dead. She stayed behind with the Crystal Heart, shielding the Crystal City from bombers.” She shook her head. “Even if she wasn’t dead, Chrysalis would never let her travel here. They always hated each other.”

She looked at Eros, “Was I expected to fall for that?”

“It was not our plan,” the old griffon took an effort to shrug.

“Synoval and Thranx have been part of the Changeling advisors to us for several years,” Grover said. “Synoval presented Cadance just before you came. I am glad you did not fall for it,” Grover smiled.

“It was obvious,” Flurry scoffed.

“Which poses a problem,” Eros said. “Because you just attacked Queen Chrysalis.”

Flurry threw her head back and laughed, causing Benito to jump and look at the door. Flurry spread her wings and knocked some cleaning supplies off the shelves as she laughed again at the Archon’s dour look.

“I didn’t think you were funny,” Flurry said to him, settling her wings. “Are you this funny in your language?”

“It’s true,” Eros glared. Grover was blushing at her wings.

“If they told you that ‘Cadance’ was Chrysalis, they were lying. She spends all her time in that stupid tower in the Changeling Lands, sucking up love and getting fat,” Flurry rolled her eyes.

Grover choked down a laugh at Eros’ glare.

“General Thranx told us,” Eros said, "it is meant to be a secret, but he has a soft spot for our Kaiser."

Flurry felt a block of ice fall into her stomach. 

“She arrived unexpectedly at the dockyards in Skyfall to the north," Eros continued, "She brought a convoy of Jaegers and fresh Panzer tanks as a gift from the embassy.” Eros squinted at her. “Officially, Queen Chrysalis is still in the Changeling Lands. She sent a telegram to congratulate our conquest of Aquileia. There will be a meeting at the capitol in Griffenheim in a few days, where the embassy will request you and your father be given over to them.”

Flurry took a deep breath through her nose and closed her eyes. She hugged the mare that almost certainly killed her mother, Twilight, and her home. She tricked and almost killed that mare in a single moment. Flurry couldn’t stop the smile, but the ice remained in her stomach.

“I always heard that she was bad at pretending to be my mom,” Flurry deflected.

“She’s here for you and your father,” Eros summarized. “Wingbardy refused Changeling help when they took New Mareland and the Sisters escaped to the River Republic. I’m sure Chrysalis wants them too,” the Archon sighed. "It is a miracle that she kept up the disguise after you attacked her. She must be too proud to admit she was nearly killed by a filly."

Flurry looked at the glowing orb illuminating the room as she sized up the other occupants. “Why,” she repeated, “am I in a closet?”

“I asked Benito to take you here,” Grover replied.

“Why?” Flurry asked again.

“Because you are…” Grover paused and lifted up a claw to his beak. “You are…under my wing?” he said uncertainly. Flurry blushed and her wings fluttered.

Lucky I'm already pink, Flurry thought.

“The Kaiser means that you are under his protection,” Eros cut in, flustered. “It is a saying in the Herzland. You have pleaded for mercy before the Kaiser, and he has pledged your safety. The Changelings are our guests, but they will not respect that.”

“They demanded you be given over to them. Archon Eros bought some time, but you must leave,” Grover said, “Chrysalis will hunt you; she is very angry. We cannot take you back to Griffenheim.” Grover gave the Archon a wry look. “I am ten, and still a silly cub. The Archon will convince me to take away your protection, but you will be gone.”

"Where is Chrysalis now?" Flurry asked.

Grover shrugged his wings, "In the east wing of the palace with the other Changelings." He blinked as Flurry's horn sparked with a bolt of electricity, then shook his head, "You surprised her, but she will be surrounded by her best guards."

"She defeated Celestia before the war during your parent's wedding," Eros reminded.

"That is not that great of an achievement," Flurry replied. 

The Archon swallowed to suppress a chuckle. "Even if I believed you could best her, she is technically our ally. We would be obligated to defend her, even from an alicorn."

"Please," Grover implored as he clasped his claws together, "you are under my wing. Do not try to fight her."

Flurry's blue eyes looked into Grover's gold, then she dismissed the static around her horn with a sigh.

“I need to find my father.” Flurry changed tactics. “I won’t let him be buried in some ditch.”

“Your father shielded Flowena during the advance. It held off our tanks for a week before collapsing. The city is mostly rubble; we lost far too many griffons in street fighting,” Eros dismissed. "We aren't even sure he is dead, neither are the Aquileians we captured, including Président Gaudreau."

“He would have come for me. I will find my father. You cannot deny me that,” Flurry demanded.

“Listen,” Eros stepped forward in the cramped space and grabbed her muzzle. His claw didn’t shake anymore. “If your father is alive, he would want you to escape. If he is dead, then he died fighting a war against us for nothing, and you are the last of your line. We did not want to kill him, but he chose to be our enemy,” Eros spat. “He could have stayed here with you.”

“Love is the death of duty,” Flurry replied around his talon.

Eros looked at her strangely and removed his talon. “An odd saying,” he remarked. “Your father’s?”

“My mother’s.”

“A strange saying for the Princess of Love,” Eros replied dubiously.

“It was the last thing she said to me,” Flurry replied, “before I was sent east with the retreating forces.”

Grover stepped forward in the small closet and held a claw up towards the glowing orb. The light reflected on his glasses.

“Princess Flurry Heart,” he began in a squeaky voice. “I swear that your father will be found and given a full burial with honors. He will rest in Griffenheim with my father until you reclaim your empire as I have.”

“Pinkie promise?” Flurry asked.

“What?”

“Cross my heart, hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.” Flurry did the motions as best she could in the cramped space. Grover copied her after a moment, stuttering through the unfamiliar Aquileian. He smiled at her when he finished.

"A strange promise," he commented.

"Breaking it is the fastest way to lose a friend," Flurry said.

Benito’s ear twitched and he listened at the door for a moment before shaking his head.

"I am proud to be your friend, Princess Flurry," Grover stated, "I will fulfill your promise."

“Okay,” Flurry nodded. “How do I get out of here and where do I go?”

“There’s several convoys leaving the harbor, volunteers from the River Republic returning back to the Riverlands,” Eros stated. “They fought for Aquileia, but they don’t want to start a proper war with us,” he grumbled. "Benito will take you."

“I do not want a war with the east. You can go to your Aunties,” Grover said. "We will send a message to the River Republic once you are on the boat."

“No,” Flurry immediately replied. “I don’t want to see them.”

“Why not?” Eros scoffed.

“They quit.”

Grover laughed at the Archon. “You said the same thing."

Benito said something in Herzlander and Grover nodded, much to the Archon’s exasperation.

“There’s a ship leaving for Nova Griffonia with volunteers and refugees, but we are hostile to them,” Eros summarized.

“I forbid our boats from attacking," Grover cut in. "Griffons can leave if they wish; I will not cause my subjects more harm." Grover cleared his throat. "Besides," he admitted, "our boats are not very good.”

“My Kaiser,” Eros said, “we have discussed this.” He ran a claw down his beak.

The regent and his charge argued softly in Herzlander while Flurry thought.

Nova Griffonia was north of Equestria and the Crystal Empire. It was the last bastion of hope on the continent; everyone else had submitted to Chrysalis. Some ponies had fled north during the chaotic retreat, racing to stay ahead of Chrysalis' tanks. The Republic of Nova Griffonia remained officially neutral during the war, but took in any refugees that made it across the border.

“Chrysalis hasn’t attacked them?” Flurry asked, ending the argument.

“We don’t know why,” Eros answered. “Something must be wrong in Equestria.”

“The tanks they just brought are not as good as the one Chrysalis got for my birthday a few years ago,” Grover added. "Thranx taught me how to drive it. These new tanks look cheap."

“I want to go to Nova Griffonia,” Flurry nodded.

Eros gave her a look; the same look of disapproval her father used to give her. “Do you have friends there, Princess?”

“Yes,” Flurry lied, “Crystal Ponies went there during the retreat.” Sunburst's convoy got left behind. He might have made it to the border, Flurry justified to herself.

Eros narrowed his eyes, but Grover clapped his claws together. He spoke in Herzlander rapidly to Benito, then turned to Flurry.

“Benito will take you to the docks. You will get on a boat to Nova Griffonia. You can trust Benito.”

“I do,” Flurry affirmed. 

“Benito will give you money,” Grover continued. “You can find your friends in Nova Griffonia.”

"Your Aquileian is good. You can pass as a local pony at a distance. Can you hide your wings with magic?" Eros asked.

"No," Flurry said and grabbed a uniform off one of the shelves with her magic, then discarded it. She continued rummaging about the shelves until she found one cut for a pony. 

It was a rather bland and unassuming blue jumpsuit meant for cleaning staff. Uncaring of her audience, Flurry tore her dress off with magic and slipped it on.

Benito, Grover, and Eros turned away abruptly with a cough.

“Clearly, none of you have been to Equestria,” she said under her breath.

Flurry had to roll up the sleeves halfway, but her freakish Alicorn height and oversized wings finally paid off, and she filled out the jumpsuit well enough to pass for a teenager. Her wings twitched, stuffed inside the jumpsuit, but Flurry had a lot of practice keeping them still under starched dresses. She cleared her throat and Grover and the Archon turned around, signaling Benito to step into the hallway, weapons drawn.

Grover was still blushing when he looked at Flurry, whose mane had dried into a stringy mess during their conversation. She looked nothing like a princess, but he didn't look much like a kaiser.

“G-good luck, Princess Flurry Heart,” he stammered. “I hope to see you again one day in Nova Griffonia.”

“Thank you, Kaiser Grover,” Flurry replied. “I wish you luck as well.”

Benito stuck his head through the doorway. “We go now,” he said in broken Aquileian.

Flurry and Grover nodded as she brushed past his blushing beak. The Archon looked down at her as she passed him. He opened his beak to say something, but closed it again. As she exited, he finally said “I will pray for your safety, Princess.”

Flurry smiled back and left.

Benito led her for several hours through the streets, bypassing checkpoints and taking side alleys when possible. Apparently, he was well-known enough not to be questioned, and he occasionally ordered several ponies and griffons that were walking behind them seized for questioning by passing Reich soldiers. Flurry wasn’t sure they were Changelings, but Benito never stayed to check. 

There was a massive crowd at the dockyard, and Reich soldiers were clearly overwhelmed trying to keep the native Aquileians under control. Benito shoved his way through the crowd as Flurry followed. His ears pinned back as kept glancing back at her. At the front of the crowd, he grabbed a soldier by the helment and barked something in his face. The Griffon stammered a reply, and Benito grabbed Flurry by the horn and dragged her towards a pier, barreling through the crowd with an escort of soldiers.

They stopped against the railing at the end of the pier, among a crowd of Ponies and Griffons carrying bags. Benito pointed to a ship sailing away. Flurry recognized the Nova Griffonian flag.

“Griffon ship,” he said in Aquileian.

“I can fly,” Flurry said. She braced herself on the railing and began to unzip the jumpsuit.

Benito began to reply, but his ear twitched and he whirled around. In one smooth motion, he unholstered his pistol and jammed it under a unicorn mare’s head and pulled the trigger. The unicorn mare’s own gun tumbled out of her green magic as the crowd screamed and surged away.

“Fly!” Benito barked.

Flurry flew. She tore off her jumpsuit in a flare of magic and flew all the way to the ship, corkscrewing to throw off any bullets, before abruptly crashing onto the deck of the old steamer crowded with wounded and angry griffons. She was utterly naked, her purple and blue mane was a windswept stringy mess, and she did not receive money from Benito.

One griffon with an eye patch leveled a rifle at her. A crowd had gathered on the aft deck to watch her fly towards them as a riot erupted on the docks.

“Stop right there and fly right back,” he growled in Equestrian.

“I can stop or I can fly back, idiot. I can’t do both,” she retorted in Equestrian, earning some wary chuckles from the crowd.

“Think you’re a comedian, filly?” the griffon replied. He was wearing a dirty camouflaged jacket over a bandaged wing.

“No,” Flurry said before stretching her wings out and lighting up her horn with a spark of lightning. “I am Princess Flurry Heart, heir to the Crystal Empire and Equestria.”

“Now, that’s funny,” the griffon laughed and lowered his rifle. “They’re both gone, filly. No one cares anymore.”

Flurry stood tall as the griffon continued to laugh down at her, even as the crowd joined in in mocking the disheveled and naked filly, even as tears came to her eyes, even as she recognized that she was the last of her family except for two ancient sisters half a world away.

Flurry stood proud on the deck of a strange ship, bound for a strange land, surrounded by defeated and tired griffons that laughed at her pride.

She finally understood how her father had thrown aside his crown.

“Princess Flurry?”

A voice broke through the scattered laughter.

A crystal pony pushed through the crowd. “I heard you’d been killed.” He looked at her in awe.

“Princess?” Another crystal pony, a mare with a wounded foreleg, emerged between two griffons. They stopped laughing.

A batpony landed to her right, cradling a rifle between two hooves. “I thought you got captured by the changelings,” he said.

“The griffons,” Flurry replied, sniffling way tears. “I escaped. I used a cleaning outfit to hide my wings.” The crowd began to chatter in a variety of languages, only half of which Flurry knew.

A unicorn pushed her way past, a mare in a tattered Equestrian uniform with sagging gray eyes. She eyed Flurry suspiciously before lighting up her horn with a gray burst of magic. The crowd quieted down. Wordlessly, she swept her horn over Flurry. Flurry felt the magic brush across her and recognized the spell.

“Auntie Twilight made that spell. I could never figure it out. Sunburst told me if I got it wrong, I could make some poor pony or changeling explode.” Flurry smiled at her.

The gray-eyed unicorn stared at her a moment longer as the ponies around her shared uncertain looks.

Then she knelt. “Princess Flurry Heart.”

Two more crystal ponies pushed their way through the crowd, stopping before Flurry with tears in their eyes.

“Princess!” They exclaimed together and knelt as one.

A griffon in a blue Aquileian uniform burst forth, knocking the one-eyed griffon aside. “Little Flurry,” she shouted in Aquileian, “I served under your father!”

Another griffon followed her. “We would have never escaped if not for his magic.”

The two griffons bowed; claw clasped on their heart in the Aquileian way.

“Princess,” a pegasus stepped forward, speaking in Prench. “I saw your father in Flowena. There was no finer unicorn in the entire army.” He bent his forelegs in an elaborate bow.

“Princess Flurry,” the batpony lowered his rifle to the ground and inclined his head. Flurry remembered batponies in the Night Guard doing the same for Luna.

The one-eyed griffon that laughed at her was pushed back as more ponies and griffons made their way forward. Flurry could only stare as a dozen, then two dozen, then more and more creatures faced her with shock in their faces and tears in their eyes.

An earth pony in a New Marelander expeditionary outfit knelt to her right. “I should’ve gone with your father when he left,” he said.

Flurry saw the wounded Crystal mare wince as she knelt, crying. “I came to fight for your father, but I was too late,” she sobbed. “Please forgive me, Princess!” She waited for Flurry to respond. All of them were waiting for her to respond.

Flurry looked around the crowd. Equestrian and Crystal uniforms blended with Aquileian and Nova Griffonian. This was a ship of losers, Flurry thought, leaving another war lost. Nova Griffonia’s time was coming, whether by the Reich or by Chrysalis.

Flurry Heart was ten years old, almost eleven. She wanted to fly away, back to her mother and father and castle. She wanted to wake up in her bed in the Empire, yelling at Aunt Luna for giving her such a bad dream. She wanted to go back to Grover and see if she could make him blush again. She wanted Auntie Twilight to read her another bedtime story.

Flurry Heart closed her eyes and took a breath. She couldn’t do any of that. And her subjects needed her.

“As long as I live, the Crystal Empire is not lost,” she said, projecting her voice like her mother.

“I know you are tired; I know you are hurt," Flurry looked at the wounded Crystal mare, pulling her back to her hooves with a flare of magic. "But as long as you live, the Crystal Empire is not lost."

"Princess," the mare sobbed.

“As long as you live, Equestria is not lost,” Flurry looked at the gray-eyed mare, then the batpony.

“Princess!” Everypony around her called out.

“As long as you live, Aquileia is not lost,” Flurry looked at the two griffons, speaking in Aquileian.

“Princess!” The griffons in the crowd matched the shout. It was the one word of Equestrian that everyone knew.

“As long as you live, New Mareland is not lost,” Flurry smiled at the earth pony, flapping her wings as she reared up.

“Princess!” The crowd shouted in unison.

“As long as we live, we have not lost!” Flurry shouted in Equestrian. Her voice echoed across the deck.

“PRINCESS!”

“PRINCESS!”

“PRINCESS!”

The crowd roared until the captain came onto the deck to investigate. Flurry Heart got his cabin.

She cried herself to sleep in it every night until the ship landed in Weter in Nova Griffonia.
> Part Three
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

It took three days for the old steamer to chug into port at Weter, the capital of Nova Griffonia. The captain, an old brown griffon named Hayes, had been very gracious to Flurry the whole trip.

He was utterly terrified of her, Flurry realized at dinner in his cabin. The trick was the eyes: they tracked her horn instead of making eye contact. Flurry remembered a similar look in the maids and servants in the Crystal Empire, after she destroyed the Crystal Heart with her foalish wailing. Her parents expanded their staff after the Crystal Ponies began reclaiming the Frozen North, but Flurry could recognize the old staff by how they looked at her.

Captain Hayes looked at her the same way, and he had good reason to. When the news spread of her arrival on the ship, Flurry gained nearly two hundred armed and devoted veterans on board, outnumbering his own crew. Crystal Ponies, Equestrians, and New Marelanders pledged fealty on the aft deck. A few dozen Aquileian griffons joined them, loyalty to her father proving stronger than loyalty to the fallen republic. The ship ended up a floating diplomatic crisis.

Nova Griffonia accepted any refugee that made it across the border, pledging neutrality during the Great War, but they had never offered to take in a Princess. When Flurry was five, the governor of the colony was assassinated outside his house, and the country nearly fell in a military coup. By the time Nova Griffonia stabilized into a republic, the war had turned thoroughly against Equestria and the Crystal Empire. The new president claimed to her mother they were too weak to help against Chrysalis. It might have even been true.

Nova Griffonia never offered to shelter the Princesses, and nopony ever asked them to consider it. But hundreds of thousands of ponies missed the boats to New Mareland and fled north to the border before Chrysalis’ panzers caught up to them. Nova Griffonia ended up with a sizable pony diaspora, straining its already flagging economy to the limit.

The night before the ship reached Weter, a pair of bat ponies left to fly ahead and Flurry went to bed with two Crystal Ponies guarding her room. The next morning, Flurry Heart stood next to a despondent Captain Hayes on deck and stared at a cheering crowd of ten thousand assorted ponies at the dock.

All of them were armed. 

Most ponies made it across the border with only their guns and the President of Nova Griffonia, Blackpeak, believed that their extra armaments could mean the difference if Chrysalis or the Reich invaded. President Blackpeak met the ship at the dock to speak to Flurry personally. Judging from the way he kept tugging on his brown shirt collar, he regretted letting them keep their weapons.

Flurry had no crown, no parents, and no legal guardian. Flurry did have an army of jubilant ponies that would doubtless be very angry if she was turned away. The gray-eyed mare, Lieutenant Dusty, spoke with Blackpeak and made a compromise, admitting Flurry as an underage refugee, but officially did not acknowledge her standing as a Princess. He stood with Flurry on the deck and shook her hoof to a cheering crowd of ponies that stomped their hooves in welcome.

Flurry didn’t mention that the last president that shook her hoof ended up deposed by an invading army.

Thorax found her shortly afterwards on the dock, disguised as ‘Crystal Hoof,’ the bland pony he wore when they first met. Flurry nearly skewered him with her horn before she remembered to ask her unicorns to verify his identity. Lieutenant Dusty scanned the undisguised, naked changeling squirming in Flurry's magic over before nodding to her.

“Yeah, that’s my neighbor Thorax.” Dusty gave him a grim smile and shook the rifle at her flank. "Our Princess is quick on the draw," she commented to the gathered crowd. Some of them looked warily at the changeling, but most smiled.

“I’m so sorry Thorax,” Flurry admitted, pulling him into a hug before letting him down.

“No, no, caution is good,” Thorax said, hugging her back. He lost weight, seemed thinner and leaner, the holes in his legs were more pronounced, like his fangs. Thorax traded radio broadcasts with Cadance during the war, urging his fellow changelings to defect and embrace friendship and harmony. He’d been with Sunburst during the evacuation.

Flurry had no idea he was alive.

Princess Flurry Heart did her duty and greeted the cheering crowd, politely asked them to disperse like Blackpeak asked and promised to speak again over the radio. She followed Thorax, Dusty, and a few dozen veteran ponies through the crowd to a small, cramped ghetto in Weter. 

The buildings were made of unpainted brink and uncomfortably grouped together. There was no sign of the traditional open-air griffon architecture; this had been built quickly and cheaply. Ponies cheered for her in the street as her motley guard passed. Most of ponies were naked like her or wore stitched up old clothes. A foal wearing an old sack stopped in front of them before being snatched up by an overly apologetic stallion in a poorly-tailored suit meant for a griffon.

“There’re a few dozen settlements, mostly in the mountains to the west or near the Equestrian border,” Dusty explained with Thorax nodding along. “The griffons want our guns to fight, but they can’t give us proper homes. There’s not enough jobs, either. Those of us that got jobs," Dusty grimaced, "got them in Triton’s Armories on the coast or the mines in the mountains.”

“Isn’t the President Triton Blackpeak?” Flurry asked.

“How do you think he got elected?” Dusty snorted, "he's one of the only ones to give us jobs. He's got a few hundred thousand ponies voting for him." Dusty, Thorax, and Flurry walked up to a three-story tenement with leaky windows and chipped paint on the door. Dusty patted the rifle at her side as she opened the door as a pair of armed ponies opened the front doors for them.

She turned to Thorax. “I’ll do the rounds, set up some guards again. You talk to your ‘lings, too.”

“They’re already set up,” Thorax replied. He led Flurry up the stairs past three unicorns with green eyes that only nodded at her. Flurry tensed, but Thorax’s easy demeanor reassured her. He led her to apartment 206, but the ‘6’ was hanging upside down. Flurry wrenched it upright and affixed it with a glue spell.

“I’ll need you to fix some of the stool legs in the kitchen,” Thorax chuckled as he led her in.

It was three rooms, with a bare stove in the kitchen, an unvarnished table beside it, a frayed purple couch next to a dirty window and uneven stools around the table. Flurry took it in with a blink.

It was nowhere near as bad as shelled-out houses.

She sat down on a stool and cast a repair spell on the leg. It still wobbled, but now the leg was too long. She huffed and tossed her fraying purple and blue curls. Thorax sat across from her on his own stool. He glanced over her head at the door. There was movement outside in the hallway and a short whistle. Thorax whistled back with a chirp.

“Are we safe here?” Flurry asked.

“Of course,” Thorax replied. “Do you have anything on the ship?”

“No, I left in a hurry. Reich soldiers caught me and were going to give me to the Changelings,” Flurry replied. “I escaped and flew from the docks to the ship.”

Thorax’s smile twitched. “Please,” he said slowly, “there’s no need to lie, Princess.”

Flurry met his look. “Don’t lie to me either.” Thorax looked away first.

“Am I safe here?” Flurry repeated.

“No,” Thorax sighed, “but you’re safer here in Weter than any of the border towns. This is the oldest and most populated pony neighborhood. Chrysalis could send a strike team across the border, but not into Weter, not without starting a war. She knows I’m here, and that I’m helping the Nova Griffonians watch out for infiltrators.”

Flurry looked around the room. “You work for the government and live here?”

“It’s the biggest room in the building,” Thorax replied.

Flurry’s muzzle scrunched in shame and swished her tail nervously. “I’m sorry, Thorax. Dad thought you died with Sunburst.”

“Sunburst’s truck got strafed by a fighter and we had to keep going,” Thorax began, “I ended up leading a few hundred ponies north with the changelings that defected. We barely made it across the border.”

“Who else is here?”

“Most of the Crystal Ponies went to the border instead of trying for the coast. General Diamond Dowser and Colonel Heartsong are the highest ranked.” Thorax continued to list the names of ponies that Flurry barely remembered before he paused and closed his eyes.

“Princess Flurry,” Thorax asked, “many of the Crystal Ponies volunteered to fight with your father in Aquileia. I…if you don’t want to-”

“My father is dead,” Flurry cut him off. “I had to leave before they found the body, but he’s dead. Chrysalis showed up wearing my mother’s face and tried to drag me back.”

Thorax slumped against the table and his wings buzzed weakly. “I’m so sorry, Flurry.”

Flurry shook her head and whickered. “Grover protected me, came up with the story that I escaped. His bodyguard helped me get to the dock.”

Thorax lifted his head back up. “Why?”

“He promised.” Flurry shrugged her wings.

“He promised to get you to Nova Griffonia?”

“No,” Flurry smiled. “He promised to keep me safe. This was my idea. I wanted to go here. Some changelings chased us, but I got away.” I hope Benito is okay, Flurry thought.

“Their alliance with the Chrysalis might be over, then,” Thorax considered. “She’s still broadcasting in Canterlot, but that could be a recording.”

“If she’s still gone, we could say something, tell ponies,” Flurry said. Her wings started fluttering. “They could rise up!”

Thorax shook his head, “No, most ponies are Nova Griffonian citizens now. It’s been years, Flurry. Nova Griffonia won’t risk a war, especially not with Chrysalis."

“I don’t need their permission. They’re Ponies, and I’m their Princess,” Flurry responded. “They want to live like this?” Flurry scoffed, sweeping her wings around the room.

“No, they don’t,” Thorax replied, reaching into a cupboard with his magic. He retrieved a crinkled map and smoothed it out on the table, “but it is better than living in occupied Equestria.”

Flurry looked down at the map, showing Equestria divided into occupied governates. “I’ve seen this before,” she dismissed.

“Every few months, we get runners that escaped from the plantations or mines,” Thorax acted like he didn’t hear her. “We help get them across the border. Chrysalis is too proud and stupid to admit anypony escapes, so President Blackpeak turns a blind eye to it.”

Thorax put a hoof on Canterlot. “West and central Equestria are the only areas directly controlled from Vesapolis and the Changeling Lands, mostly because Chrysalis likes to vacation in Canterlot. Most of the garrisons are tied up there. The Everfree Forest is out of control and a center of resistance.”

He moved the hoof to the south. “The south is lawless, either desert or jungle. The governors assigned to the area keep getting assassinated. The Changelings are resorting to walled slave plantations to harvest love and rubber.”

Flurry noticed he referred to changelings separately, not including himself.

He put a hoof over the empire. “The Crystal Empire is too sparsely populated to properly garrison. They can't control the weather enough to dispel the storm; the Crystal Heart only protects Crystal City, none of the farmland around it. It’s basically a research center surrounded by slave mines.”

“It shrunk?” Flurry asked. The barrier formed by the Crystal Heart was never very large, but the little circle on the map was pitiful.

“The Crystal Heart must be broken. Your mother held out for months after Equestria fell. The snow storm outside the shield brought down their bombers and planes in the hundreds. Thousands of troops froze in the snow outside as their tanks and artillery pounded the shield. The delay bought a lot of ponies time to make it here.” Thorax tapped his hoof on the map. “I think Chrysalis tried to drop some new kind of bomb on the city, but it didn’t work. We saw a flash from the border.”

“I didn’t hear any of that in Aquileia or New Mareland.”

“I doubt Chrysalis wanted to spread that around.”

“Do you know how she died?” Flurry asked.

Thorax closed his eyes. “I don’t know. The shield shattered suddenly and changelings poured in. Nopony made it out.”

Thorax blinked several times and moved a hoof to Manehatten. “The eastern coastline is led by Governor Lilac, who’s trying to be liberal with her underequipped garrison.” He smiled at Flurry. “Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon are underground, giving Lilac hell. The rebellion will start there when it starts.”

“Chrysalis is weak,” Flurry summarized. “If we rise up, we can beat them! President Blackpeak said I can go on the radio; we can tell everypony to fight.” She put her hoof over the Crystal City. “A lot of ponies live at the border, right? We can storm right over those loser guards and make it to the Crystal Heart, easy!”

"Blackpeak wants you to calm everypony down," Thorax stressed, "not rile them up for war. Nova Griffonia is committed to defense, against Chrysalis or the Reich."

"Then what's the point of telling me any of this?" Flurry complained.

“My point,” Thorax tapped the map, “is that the rebellion already started the moment Chrysalis set a holed hoof in Equestria. Ponies are doing all they can. Sometimes that means sabotaging a train or attacking a garrison, sometimes that means bringing home enough food for tomorrow. Getting on the radio and shouting to fight won’t change that.”

“I want to help them."

“Are you doing it for them or for you?” Thorax challenged.

Flurry didn't respond immediately. "I'm their Princess," she answered defiantly.

Thorax continued staring her down with solid blue eyes. “So, you'll go on the radio. Did all those speeches on the radio from Celestia and Luna help New Mareland fight?”

Flurry clamped her muzzle shut and her stomach twisted. “Don’t compare me to them,” she strained out between gritted teeth.

“Are you going to fight?”

“If I have to.”

“An alicorn on the field doesn’t guarantee victory; Luna proved that twice.”

“It would have been different if Celestia and Twilight helped.”

“Maybe,” Thorax conceded, “or they could have all died fighting on the front and destroyed any hope of victory. Besides, Twilight spent the war researching new weapons. Are you stronger than Luna? Are you smarter than Twilight?” he asked.

“Not yet,” Flurry bit out.

“So, you can’t fight yet,” Thorax concluded, “would you like to shout for ponies to fight on the radio? Do you want them to hear your voice as they die, calling for them to give everything for you, like Celestia?”

“Stop it!” Flurry covered her ears.

“Will you write condolence letters like your mother, assuring their families that they died for a higher cause while sitting in a crystal castle?”

“DON’T YOU DARE MOCK MOM!”

The entire building rattled. Flurry’s horn fired a bolt of lightning that scorched the ceiling. Two disguised changelings burst in through the door, took one look at Flurry, then backed out.

Flurry Heart’s muzzle twitched uncontrollably as she heaved, floating in the air in her own magical aura. Her wings buzzed, causing a gale to blow up dust and knock the map off the table. She hung in the air like an inert pendulum before Thorax.

Thorax stayed on his stool and gripped the table for balance. He stared up at Flurry as she glared down at him, tears falling from her eyes. She bared her teeth at him with a snarl fit for a Diamond Dog.

“I loved your mother,” Thorax said calmly. Flurry stilled her wings to hear him, but remained floating in her magic. “Writing those letters destroyed her. She wasn’t a fighter,” he admitted, “but she did everything could until the end."

He kept eye contact, not staring at the electrical arcs coming from her horn. "When the city finally fell, Chrysalis gave the city to Hive Marshal Trimmel. His first act was to hang my brother from one of the balconies of the Crystal Palace. Chrysalis said he helped me escape.”

Flurry took a shuddering breath as she tried to calm down. “Pharynx?”

“Yes,” Thorax said, chuckling to himself. “We hadn’t talked for years, and our last conversation ended with him swearing to bring me before Chrysalis." He snorted. "But that’s exactly the kind of leader Chrysalis is. She watched the war from that damn tower in Vesapolis, gave speeches on the radio for changelings to die to, then executed her best panzer commander.”

“She lied,” Flurry righted the stool and fixed it again with a flare of blue magic.

“No,” Thorax laughed, “Pharynx's tank broke down while his brigade was chasing us across the tundra. He made the whole brigade stop and wait for him to repair it. He wanted to be there when I was caught, you see.”

“I don’t understand,” Flurry sat down on the stool. It didn’t wobble.

“He faked the breakdown,” Thorax said. “Pharynx was always a good liar, even to other changelings, but it was too suspicious.” Thorax closed his eyes and sighed. “He did what he could, when it counted.”

He opened his eyes. “What kind of princess can you be right now?”

“I can go on the radio,” Flurry began and Thorax frowned.

Flurry paused. “I can tell my Ponies that I am glad so many of them came to see me, and I can tell them to give me time to settle into Nova Griffonia, like President Blackpeak asked.”

Thorax nodded with relief.

“I can visit them and see where they live. I can show them I care.”

Thorax hesitated, but nodded. “We can do that. We'll use it as a chance to set up your legal guardian. It will just be on paper; Dusty Mark downstairs is a good choice-”

“You,” Flurry said and crossed her forelegs.

Thorax blinked. “Flurry, no.”

“You said it was just on paper. I can stay with Dusty or anypony or a spare room.”

“Flurry, I am a changeling. Nova Griffonia tolerates us because we help them, but there’s still a lot of distrust.”

“You’re Thorax, my friend and honorary uncle. You helped my mother and father. You helped raise me.”

“That was a long time ago, Flurry. Ponies don’t always remember things they should.”

“We can remind them. Besides, what better to guard against changelings than changelings?” Flurry asked, and knew she’d won the argument because Thorax looked over her head to the door as his ears pinned back.

“It’s not a good idea,” he sighed.

“Because you’re starving?”

Thorax’s head fin stiffened. “I am not.”

“Don’t lie,” Flurry reminded him, “those holes are pretty big.” She pointed at his hooves on the table. Thorax quickly shifted them under the table.

“I work with the other changelings," Thorax said quickly. "We ration. I’m just hungry. Nova Griffonia has limited trade. Food can get scarce.”

“Yeah, I bet with all that distrust, like you said.” Flurry stuck her hoof across the table and thought about the time Thorax fell asleep reading her Daring Do and the Temple of Terror.

Thorax flinched and hissed at her on reflex. “No,” he rasped, “we’re better than that." He swallowed, licking at his fangs. "It belongs to your family."

“My family,” Flurry said wistfully. “You’re the closest thing to family I have left, and you can tell that's not a lie.”

Princess Flurry Heart and Thorax the Exile stared at each other. Flurry's ears twitched as it began to rain outside. Thorax's window started to leak.

Thorax shut his eyes and slowly reached out with a holed hoof that was more hole than actual hoof. Flurry Heart sat quietly as she felt the pull on her magic. It was barely more than a drop being drawn from an ocean. They sat together in the rundown kitchen, now slightly more battered due to Flurry’s outburst.

“My brother was right. I really am an idiot,” Thorax laughed with a sniffle. "I'm sorry I said all those things."

"They needed to be said," Flurry answered. "I'm sorry I yelled at you. Mom always said a Princess needs wise counsel."

Thorax laughed again and Flurry giggled.

Flurry glanced at the scorch mark on the ceiling.

I need to control my magic better; I can’t fight with it, not without probably destroying a building. I can’t write letters for ponies who died for me. I can't call them to war without fighting myself. Dad taught me about guns, but didn't teach me to shoot, she thought.

But she had time to learn.

All of it.

If Thorax objected, he was only her legal guardian on paper.

I am a Princess.
> Part Four
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flurry Heart levitated the last slice of her pink birthday cake to the foal. It was the slice with the ‘12’ on top.

His brown eyes, wide as dinner plates, gaped at the slice as it gracefully landed on his plate. His mother nudged him with a rear hoof and adjusted the conical pink party hat on his gray mane.

“T-thank you, Princess,” he stammered.

His mother, a green-eyed white unicorn, bowed to her. “We are grateful for your generosity, Princess Flurry.”

Flurry waved a pink wing at her. “It’s nothing,” she said as she leaned close to the mare. “Did he have cake for his birthday?” she whispered into her ear.

The mare shook her head.

“Then consider it a belated gift.” Flurry smiled, then trotted back to the head of the table next to Thorax, who sat undisguised in a bulky brown jacket. He had two holstered pistols along his barrel.

It was hard to tell with changelings, but he was scanning the room, seeking nods of confirmation from tactically-placed ponies in the crowd.

“I wish you would wait for guests to approach, Princess,” he remarked with a sigh as Flurry sat down.

“I will not fear for my life at my birthday party, Uncle,” Flurry snorted. “You’re bad enough at the soup kitchen.”

“You will mean far more to your ponies alive, Princess.”

“I mean nothing to them if they do not see me,” Flurry replied, tapping a hoof on her empty plate. It was clean.

Thorax glanced at the plate. “Did you have any cake? Opal Agate used her month’s allotment of flour for it,” he whispered.

“Of course, Uncle,” Flurry replied back loudly, smiling at Opal from across the room. “The cake was so delicious I licked my plate clean; such a fine cake deserved to be shared.”

Opal smiled back and her blue crystal coat shimmered a bit brighter under her apron. It wasn’t the same smile Flurry remembered from the Crystal Kitchens, but it was close. An earth pony next to her clapped her shoulder in celebration. A pegasus chased a griffon cub around the table, laughing at the role reversal.

“I can tell when you’re lying,” Thorax sighed.

“You should be able to tell that it was only half a lie,” Flurry shot back. “They deserve it more than me.”

Thorax sighed and leaned back on the stool, but didn’t argue with her. Flurry knew that meant he was too proud to be annoyed. Flurry leaned back and shook the party hat on her horn, making it light up in her blue magic. Some of the foals pointed and laughed.

Heartshovel was two days travel on hoof to the border of the Crystal Empire. It was a mining town, nestled deep in the Crystal Mountains, and exported tungsten that went east to the armories on the coastline of Nova Griffonia. Griffons abhorred digging in a hole, so gladly farmed the work out to the poor and destitute refugees that had fled to their lands. The Republic of Nova Griffonia had racial equality written into its constitution, but what was on paper was rarely done in practice.

Heartshovel had a population of a thousand, of which only a quarter were griffons, remnants of the stubborn mountain clans that had tried to rebel before the Great War. They hated the government far more than they hated ponies, so the griffins kept their traditional grouchiness to a minimum. Flurry Heart pledged to visit every refugee town once a year around her birthday, then return to Weter and speak with the Aquileians. This was the second year she traveled, and this time she was sure to mention how grateful she was to President Blackpeak at every stop, encouraging her ponies to vote for him in the upcoming election.

Except when she stopped at New Stalliongrad, which burned an effigy of her in protest for the second year in a row. She told them not to vote for Blackpeak, which guaranteed some of the communists would do so out of spite.

She didn’t care for Blackpeak, but he was dependent on the pony vote to be reelected, which made him dependent on her. He had yet to press the issue of her title, only asking her not to use it when she went on the radio.

"Everypony knows you are their princess," he said with false cheer. "It is not necessary." Flurry nodded dutifully and thanked him for his hospitality. He never used her title.

Opal had been one of the head chefs in the kitchen back home; she worked in the canteen for the mine with her three fillies. Flurry was ecstatic to meet her last year and promised to return for her next birthday. Opal had nervously accepted on behalf of the town.

Heartshovel tried to welcome their Princess properly. They scrounged together a choir of colts and fillies to sing off-key, set up a discolored banner on main street, and set aside the town’s meeting hall to host her party. It was a wooden, off-white building with dust-streaked windows. Even the griffons came to see her and share their one joke about the town.

“Is it called Heart’s Hovel or Heart Shovel? Can you settle the question, Princess of Ponies?” The old griffon had used the same joke last year, and spat her title with a crooked grin.

"You may call it what you wish. It is your home as well," Flurry replied, sweeping her wings to include the combined crowd. There was less mockery afterwards.

Princess Flurry Heart didn’t care about the celebration. She didn’t care that the gifts ranged from mining equipment to rare emeralds stolen from the mine. She didn’t care that the party was clearly meant for the Princess her Ponies fondly remembered, the little foal that giggled at anything vaguely funny and struggled with big words.

She was their Princess, and that meant her birthday was not about her.

In every town she visited, the gifts would be accidentally left behind and the food would be given out to her colts and fillies. She would see the miners that had been crippled in the frequent accidents, heal what she could with her limited magic, and collapse during the ride to the next town. She would repeat the process until she returned to Weter, where she would attend the Aquileian Veteran’s meeting to thank the griffons that served with her father. She would listen to stories about the old Discret Kings and the Republicans. She would end her birthday on the radio, thanking pony and griffon alike for their hospitality.

Thorax and some disguised changelings traveled along with her volunteer guard. Flurry didn’t now the exact number of changelings, but she trusted Thorax. Queen Chrysalis remained silent on Flurry’s presence in the north, but her spies sought her ruthlessly. Flurry Heart learned Twilight’s Changeling Detection Spell from Dusty Mark before her eleventh birthday.

There had been one attempt last year, the first year she started her tour. Flurry Heart stayed in Evergreen for a night; it was the largest Pony town in the mountains and three days from the border. Thorax’s agents were struggling to secure the area, but Flurry wanted to get some rest before returning to Weter and dismissed his concerns. A Changeling spy poisoned her soup, probably to knock her out at night and abduct her with some other agents.

Flurry gave it to a homeless foal begging outside her hotel. 

He collapsed within a minute after thanking her profusely and taking a sip.

Poison for alicorns wasn’t the same as poison for foals. He lived, only thanks to Thorax carrying several antidotes as a paranoid precaution.

The hotel waived the damage Flurry did to their kitchen. The Changeling spy died choking on a cyanide capsule, still in his chef’s hat. The real chef was tied up in the pantry, terrified and nearly decapitated by Flurry’s magical blast that obliterated the outer wall. No other Changelings were discovered, and a Changeling broadcast from Canterlot dismissed it an act of terrorism by a rogue agent. Blackpeak gracefully accepted the excuse on Flurry's behalf.

Rioting broke out among the towns Flurry visited.

Princess Flurry Heart could’ve called her ponies to war, but she instead returned to Weter with Thorax.

“Next year, we will double our agents, Princess,” he pleaded. “I swear it.”

Thorax only called her Princess when he was upset.

“No, it was a mistake.”

“The trip did so well, Princess. Take it from a changeling, everywhere you visited was happier and more hopeful than it had been in years.”

“Now they riot, but I wasn’t talking about the trip. I made a mistake,” Flurry said in her room. She had her own one-room apartment on the second-floor, across from Thorax. He wasn’t home very often, but there were enough guards at all hours, day or night. It was on the inside of the building, with no windows and one door, with one vent for a tiny stove. The only amenities were a private shower and toilet, which was a luxury for the tenement and the ghetto.

“It was my job to know about the soup.”

“No,” Flurry replied on her bed. She stared up at an old Wonderbolt poster on the ceiling and wondered if Rainbow Dash was alive. “That would never have happened if I didn’t demand to stay the night." 

Thorax didn't refute her. His wings buzzed uncomfortably.

"Next year, I sleep on the road and we take different roads between the towns," Flurry said. "No known schedule. I start the visits two weeks before my birthday and we pass by some towns then circle back. We go to Heartshovel on my birthday, then return directly to Weter.”

Thorax thought about it. “That will be difficult.”

“What do you suggest?”

“No, I meant it will be difficult for you,” Thorax said. Flurry blinked and raised her head off her lumpy pillow.

“You won’t get much sleep between towns,” Thorax began slowly. “You’ll end up visiting some of them at night, some during the day. Ponies will be happy to see you anytime, but we'll be always be on the move. Are you sure you want to do this?”

“Yes,” Flurry replied. “Set the alarm for an hour. I need to go down to Weter Radio to stop the rioting and announce that I believe the Changeling was a rogue agent.” She yawned. “It’s good Chrysalis can’t detect lies over the radio.”

It had been a good plan, and it worked well, but Flurry dreaded the ride out of Heartshovel on the dirt road through the mountains. She slumped in the back of the truck and removed her party hat. Her dress, a simple white-frilled blue skirt, was flecked with brown and black stains from dirt and coal with a smudge of icing from a hug.

Dusty Mark and a few of her guards climbed into the old troop carrier after her. Dusty Mark was technically an unemployed mercenary, along with nearly a third of the ponies living in the ghetto in Weter. The rest worked in the armories. Flurry Heart had a core guard of almost a hundred Equestrians and Crystal Ponies that patrolled the ghetto as a militia. Money came in from somewhere Thorax didn’t want Flurry to know about to support her guards and their families, but she trusted him enough not to pry.

"I hate this truck," Flurry groused. "The other two don't jump around as much."

"I don't think it will make a difference on this road, Princess," Frosty Jadis replied. She was Crystal mare that knelt to Flurry Heart while sobbing on the ship two years ago. Her leg had healed poorly. She couldn't gallop, but she could hit a target at extreme range and was the most devoted of Flurry's guard. She closed the back doors of the truck and peered out the reinforced glass. Three trucks traveled with Flurry, and she changed trucks every stop, sometimes on the road as well.

If the worst happened and they were attacked, Flurry could teleport. Flurry's teleportation wasn't exactly stable, but she had been told to immediately jump away if ordered to by her guards. She couldn't take anypony with her yet, not like her Aunt Twilight. It was something to work on later.

Flurry leaned her head back. "Wake me in Weter." Her curls began to bounce as the truck moved.

"It's a long drive. We'll change trucks before we hit the main road," Dusty replied.

"Don't wake me. Just toss me in the back of the truck," Flurry commanded.

They woke her up anyway. She took the opportunity to pop her wing joints and pee on the side of the road, hiking up her skirt.

Dusty and Jadis looked away with serious muzzles, scanning the forest.

My loyal guards, Flurry thought. I'm still their Princess as I squat on the side of the road. She suppressed a laugh.

The trip back continued through the night. Her little convoy stopped once, blocked by fallen logs from a flatbed truck in a narrow pass. The poor griffon that tried to flag down the first truck was nearly shot. Flurry summoned a blue bubble shield over the convoy as Thorax and her guards secured the area and forced the driver to the ground.

"He's taking the stuff to Evergreen and the straps broke," Thorax summarized, returning from the griffon. "Not a Changeling. We'll reverse and take the side path."

"That could be a trap," Dusty suggested.

"If there's a trap, he doesn't know about it. I questioned him thoroughly," Thorax replied. The griffon slumped up against the door of his truck with a bloody beak, glaring through the shield. He looked away when Flurry glanced at him.

"I'll help him," Flurry decided. She waved at the griffon to approach with a wing. His eyes widened and his wings twitched against his overalls. He seemed to decide against trying to fly away and slowly approached.

"Princess, we don't have time," Thorax said. Flurry ignored him and watched the griffon cautiously reach a claw out and pass it through the shield.

"I'll be quick," Flurry replied. She pulled him by the claw towards her with her magic. His wings flared as he tried to pull back, but it was pointless to fight an alicorn, even a filly. She let him go a few hooves away from her. He fell to the ground and stayed down.

The griffon glanced fearfully at the armed guards and held out his claws. "Please, Princess," he pleaded. "I did not mean to ruin your birthday. I work with many ponies. I saw you at Evergreen three days ago. I gave you a gift: fine carpentry tools."

"You ruined nothing." Flurry fired a beam of magic at his beak. He squawked in shock, clutching at it with both claws before blinking.

"I'm not the best with healing spells," Flurry admitted, "but you will not need a doctor." Flurry dispelled the shield and seized the fallen logs in her magic, stacking them back on the flatbed of his truck. She ignored the twinge in her horn. She lifted the truck and the logs together and moved them to the side of the road. The logs rested uneasily in the flatbed, so Flurry fired a large blue bolt and glued the logs to the flatbed.

Flurry blinked stars from her eyes and swallowed, looking down at the stunned griffon. "That spell will only last a few hours on something that big. You're going to Evergreen?"

"Yes, Princess, to the lumber yard."

"What is your name?"

"Gunner, Princess. I am from the hills. I welcomed many ponies when they came during the war." He stood up and wiped the blood from his beak on his overalls, trying to smile at Flurry.

Thorax snorted next to him and Gunner clacked his beak shut.

"Please wait for us to pass," Flurry said apologetically.

"Of course, Princess," the griffon moved to approach Flurry, then thought better of it when Dusty conspicuously checked her rifle. He instead nodded and swept his wings in a bow before returning to his truck.

Flurry's legs collapsed out from under her once she climbed back into her own truck. Jadis leaned her against the side and wrapped her in a blanket while Thorax and Dusty looked on.

"That was too much magic, Princess," Dusty chided her.

"I'll be able to sleep until Weter for sure," Flurry responded. "I saved time anyway."

"Can you still teleport?" Thorax asked.

Flurry nodded. "Yes, Uncle." She looked out the reinforced glass and saw Gunner wave at the passing trucks.

"You know he was lying about welcoming ponies, right?" Thorax asked as he followed Flurry's eyes.

"Did he lie about giving me a gift in Evergreen? Did he lie about working with ponies?"

Thorax paused and shook his head. "Lots of griffons gave you things this year, Princess."

"Rightly so," Jadis huffed. "Our Princess spends more time helping them like they're her own Ponies, than any griffon from Weter. They should remember who'll cure their coal lung and set their broken bones for free when she visits."

Flurry closed her eyes as the truck trundled down the rough road. Her curls were matted with sweat and she needed to shower when they made it back to Weter.

I am a Princess of Ponies, and my Ponies must always come first, Flurry reminded herself, but many griffons suffer beside them. I will help them when I can, Flurry promised.

They are not my subjects by right. But when the time comes, they will be my subjects by choice.
> Part Five
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Were you waiting for me?” Flurry asked. She had just returned to Weter, leaving the trucks outside the ghetto.

“No, no,” the mailgriffon answered in accented Equestrian. He was Aquileian. He stood outside Flurry's tenement on the sidewalk,  fiddling with the brass buttons on his gray uniform with two satchels under his wings. Flurry knew Jacques; he was one of the few griffons that brought mail to the ghetto, but he traveled frequently for his job. Her horn lit up and she cast her detection spell on him.

He wasn’t a changeling.

Jacques’ feathers ruffled and he gave Flurry a sour look. “You do not trust me, Little Flurry?” Flurry stared back at him until he clacked his beak in a laugh. “Good! A monarch should never trust a republican.” He flourished the bag on his left. “I bring your birthday wishes.”

“I’ll need to check them,” Thorax interrupted.

“Please,” Jacques scoffed. “Everygriffon in the mail office has read them, including me. There is no poison or bombs. If there was, Nova Griffonia would collapse without their poorly-paid mail service.” He set down the heavy satchel. “Your mail from ponies and proud Aquileians in Nova Griffonia.” He pulled out two opened envelopes from his other satchel. “And letters abroad: your old aunts write to you.”

Flurry took the envelopes in her magic and tucked them under her wing. “Summary?”

Jacques held a claw to his beak in shock. “You dare not read the words of the immortal Princesses?” He cackled. “Oh, we will make a republican out of you yet. They ask you come visit them, offer to pay for your trip, wish you happy birthday.” He ticked off the points on a claw.

"Anything else?" 

His eyes soured as he sighed and retrieved another opened envelope. He tossed it to Flurry, who caught it in her magic. “From the great Kaiser,” he squawked. “Actually arrived on time this year. Long winded drivel about how great he is, invites you to his birthday next month. Spelled your name wrong again. Why do you even write back?”

Flurry tucked it under her other wing with a neutral expression. “His letters make good kindling.”

Jacques squawked another laugh and closed his bag. “Goodbye, Little Flurry,” he said in Aquileian. He gestured to the satchel on the ground. "I will return next week for your replies."

Flurry nodded, responding back in Aquileian. "Thank you, Jacques."

He smiled. “Of course, Little Flurry. I will see you tomorrow at the Veteran's Hall,” he promised and flared his wings, taking flight down the street and above the bustle of ponies.

Flurry Heart took the satchel in her magic and let Thorax, Dusty and her guards escort her through her building.

“If you’re tired, I can work through the letter,” Thorax offered in the stairwell.

“Nah,” Flurry replied. “Make the rounds and check on everyone, or just make some coffee and relax. I’ll do it myself.” She hugged him. "We did good this year, Uncle." Thorax nuzzled the top of her head and stopped to talk to Dusty.

Flurry Heart stopped outside the door to her room and nodded at Falx, the disguised changeling guarding the hallway, who nodded back and tapped a front hoof on the floor. She passed the floating satchel of birthday mail to him to double-check. Flurry stood in the hallway, took a deep breath, and reached out with her magic to scan her room, then reached into the walls, floor and ceiling.

Her wards hadn’t been tampered with and nothing had been breached. She still wasn’t great at defensive spells other than her barries, so she warned everypony that if they tried to force their way past her spells, her room could explode and take the building with it. Nopony was sure their Princess was serious, except Thorax and his changelings.

They refused to comment.

Flurry yawned, entered, and locked the door behind her, taking in the musty smell and muffled radio from the floor above. She threw the two letters from Celestia and Luna in the wastebasket by her desk and set the Kaiser’s letter on the bed. She teleported her dress away with a crack of blue magic. 

It landed on top of her dresser, fluttering and slightly smoking.

Flurry sighed. It would need to be pressed and cleaned later anyway. Lastly, she removed the simple gold band from under her curly mane and placed it on the dresser, on top of the dress. It was the only piece of regalia she owned, a gift for her eleventh birthday. A Crystal Pony smith had made it from wedding rings donated by unicorns. Most of them had lost their spouses during the war.

It was the only gift she kept. It reminded her of her duty.

Flurry Heart raised up a foreleg and sniffed, recoiling with a soft whicker. She definitely needed to shower before she left, but she wanted to do this now. Flurry Heart sat down on her bed and peeled away the Wonderbolt poster on the ceiling with a burst of magic, revealing a hole in plaster. The walls were too thin to have a proper secret cubbyhole, but the large crack in the ceiling was perfect to slip two folders between her ceiling and the floor above. She pulled the folders down gently with her magic and dusted them off with a flash before replacing the poster. She opened the thinner folder and retrieved her notes, scratch paper, and a pencil. Flurry rolled onto her barrel and set the letter from the Kaiser and her notes side-by-side on the bed as she began to work.

The letter from the desk of Kaiser Grover VI was written in archaic Equestrian, rife with spelling errors, syntax mistakes and enough misused words to confuse any reader. It reminded her of Luna’s letters to her mother. Aunt Twilight would have a fit, she giggled. She received a letter every two or three months since she arrived in Nova Griffonia. Flurry overheard Dusty joke to Jadis once that the Kaiser’s letters were the only reason the trade embargo was not worse. 

His first letter had been depressingly formal, lambasting her for refusing his sanctuary and hospitality and ending with a long string of absurd titles and honorifics for himself full of errors. Thorax had scanned it thoroughly and triple-checked for poison before giving it to her with an apologetic grimace. She threw it in her wastebasket and went to bed with tears in her eyes.

Two days later, Thorax tried to slam her door open. Flurry dispelled her lock and opened it to a grinning Thorax who held up the crumpled letter.

“It’s a code!” His black hooves were stained with ink.

“What?” Flurry yawned. It was four in the morning. She discreetly cast her detection spell as best she could.

Thorax didn't notice. “It’s written in a code! Look at the spelling mistakes, take every third one, then reverse the sequence!" The fin on his head was slightly bent, and he swayed on his hooves like he hadn't slept. "It spells out an abbreviated message in Herzlander,” Thorax explained. “I thought something was off; I never would have caught it if I hadn’t learned Herzlander from the Changeling Army.” Thorax passed Flurry a napkin covered in near illegible scribbles.

Princess Flurry Dog Says Safe

Happy Hear You Radio

Bugs Leave Griffons Angry

Kept Crown Will Give Back

Bye Friend

Flurry blinked, instantly awake, and shifted her eyes between the napkin and the letter.

“You kept it? I threw it out.”

Thorax’s wings rustled. “I thought something was off,” he said as he scraped a hoof on the floor. He left a trail of ink.

“You go through my trash?” Her eyes narrowed.

“No,” Thorax replied defensively. “Arex goes through your trash when she collects it.”

Thorax twitched and shifted his gaze away from Flurry’s stare. "I know it was important to you," he muttered. "The letter didn't make sense if he wanted to help you."

She pulled him into a hug. “Thanks, Uncle. Help me reply?” Flurry asked. Thorax leaned against her and she had to flare her oversized wings to hold him up. "After you get some sleep."

Thorax helped her write back in the same style, using Thorax’s old Herzlander to write a reply hidden in broken and misspelled Aquileian that begged the Kaiser for forgiveness and an end to the war against the Griffonian Republic to the north. The next letter confirmed he found it. She read it on her bed.

Princess Flurry See Reply Found Father

It hadn’t been announced over the radio. Her father was still considered missing.

Sorry Sorry Sorry

Flurry sniffled.

Father Rest Here Secret

He kept his word.

Rest Near My Father

There was a stain on the original letter. Thorax checked and said it was a teardrop.

When Pony Have Empire Father Go Home

Flurry began to cry.

Still Have Crown

She laughed through the tears.

Bye Friend

Flurry held the letter between her forelegs that night.

She kept all the past letters in her other folder, which was starting to get too large to fit in the ceiling. As far as Thorax knew, nopony or griffin had realized Grover was writing her secret messages. The Changelings might be able to figure it out, but they were too busy hunting down resistance in Equestria to deal with Flurry’s fanmail.

Flurry huffed as she worked through her scratch paper with a pencil nub, switching between Grover’s letter and Thorax’s notes. When she was finished, she meticulously copied down the letters in reverse and fetched her Herzlander-Equestrian dictionary from under the bed. She couldn’t speak it and could barely write it; nopony or griffin was eager to teach her the language of the Reich.

Thorax and his changelings knew it, but she imposed far too much of them already just to keep her safe. Changelings had their own language, a beautiful, trilling lilt that chirped and sang, but the Changeling Army and Chrysalis insisted on the harsh, guttural Herzlander as the national language. Thorax said they were trying to copy the most successful army on the planet, but Flurry believed it was just to sound crueler. She flipped through the dictionary and squinted as she translated.

Happy Best Day Princess Flurry

The official letter never used her title, but Grover always included it.

Wish Us Happy Best Day Together

Flurry smiled to herself.

War North Over Near Now

The Griffonian Reich had finally overtaken the Griffonian Republic to the north and the old Kingdom of Vedina after a brutal guerilla war. Vedina surrendered when they lost their capitol, but ships evacuated the remnants of the Republicans across the ocean to Nova Griffonia, where they were welcomed by the government. The Reich was directly across from Nova Griffonia now, and the Blackpeak declared a massive push to increase coastal bunkers and anti-air defenses. A lot of Earth Ponies and Crystal Ponies ended up employed in triple shifts along the coast, building bunkers for little pay.

War South War West

Flurry hummed. It makes sense to attack Wingbardy to the south and the borderlands against the River Republic before they expand their alliance, she thought. 

The River Republic led a coalition of foreign ponies and dogs, uneasily sharing the continent of Griffonia with the Reich. The alliance was born out of griffon aggression into the east of Griffonia centuries ago, and the coalition frequently sent aid and volunteers to the countries that had broken away from Grover. If a war broke out between the coalition and the Reich, the entire continent would be set aflame; their border stretched across most of the continent. With every reconquest by the Reich, the border grew.

Flurry occasionally caught news on the radio. Celestia spoke of the need for unity against the cruelty of the Reich, still calling herself Princess as she and her sister sat in some townhouse at the grace of River Swirl, the Chancellor of the River Republic.

Flurry’s ears twitched as she heard a pop of magic. Her eyes refocused. She had crumpled her scratch paper into a ball that was beginning to smolder in her horn’s field. She cursed and blew it out, before smoothing her paper back out and continuing.

No War River No War There

President Blackpeak would be relieved, Flurry thought with a snort.

Can Come Please Reply Bye Friend

Flurry's breath hitched and she fluttered her wings. I thought the invitation was just a formality, part of the fake letter, but it’s real. It would be trivial to fly across the ocean, even under her own power. It wouldn’t be the first time she started over in a foreign land. Queen Chrysalis never formally ended her alliance with the Reich, but the embassy had been recalled shortly after she fled to Nova Griffonia. Rumors said not everyling returned home, some choosing the Kaiser over the Queen.

Flurry stood up on her bed and cracked her neck. She could almost touch the ceiling and poster with her horn. She hopped down, crossed over to her small desk and sat on her chair, bringing out her ink, quill, and fresh parchment from the drawer. She had to rattle the drawer to close it properly. She drifted over the dictionary with her horn as she began to work.

Grover said he figured out the code on his own; Flurry believed him even if Thorax doubted it. It annoyed her a little that he was clearly smarter than her, but she had more magic than he ever would. She began to write in Herzlander.

Kaiser Grover,

Thank you for birthday wish. I happy. I wish Boreas and ancestors with you for future. 

North griffons come. Griffons mean here. Mean to Ponies. Wish Griffons remembered Twilight say Republic better than Reich. (Sorry!)

The Republicans that had just arrived were very hostile to her ponies, seeing them as more monarchists despite their citizenship. The public knowledge that Flurry shared letters with the Kaiser didn’t help, despite the assurances from President Blackpeak.

I want to come. I safe there. I want see you.

Flurry looked over her shoulder at the door as it glowed faintly blue with her locking spell. Thorax and Dusty were probably looking over the satchel of letters.

I must stay. Ponies need Princess. Griffons need Kaiser.

Take back your land.

Bye Friend. 

Flurry's horn lit up as she closed her eyes and concentrated. Flurry pointed her horn at the paper and cast the spell. She shook out her mane and looked down at the blank sheet of paper. The words would only appear for Grover himself when he looked at them; the spell was tied to him. It was a difficult spell, and Dusty and her magic tutor Far Sight had given her a weird look when she picked it out of an old book. The spell required a piece of the person it was meant to go to, like blood, hair, or saliva.

Flurry used the stain on the second letter, a teardrop. Grover's first letter after she used it was amazed at her magic.

Princess Flurry

How How How

Eros No See

See Me Stare Blank Page

Think I Mad Like Nobles

She wrote back after she stopped laughing. In her reply, she deflected it as ‘alicorn magic.’ Grover never pressed beyond that.

Flurry flipped the paper over and began to write a more vague, diplomatic reply in a mix of Aquileian and Equestrian.

From the desk of Flurry Heart,

She is overjoyed to receive the well-wishes of the Kaiser, and urges him to seek a peaceful resolution to any conflicts…

She continued for the rest of the page, filling it with foalish nonsense. Thorax would read her ‘official’ reply, sigh, knowing she was hiding her true thoughts, and pass it along. The Nova Griffonians would read it and dismiss her as a foal and useful puppet, shipping the letter back to the Reich and Grover. The Imperial Court of the Reich and the Regent would read her letter and laugh at her naivety.

Grover would flip the letter over and smile.

Princess Flurry Heart folded the letter and slipped it into the envelope from Grover, leaving it on her desk with the ink and quill. She placed his letter with the others in the folder, then stuffed the dictionary back under her bed. The poster came down again and the folders were safely tucked away between floors. Flurry laid back on her bed and stuck the poster to the ceiling. She levitated her clock over and set her alarm for two hours.

She would wake up, shower, and get on the radio this evening, shilling for Blackpeak’s reelection and thanking everyone for a memorable birthday. When she returned home, she would begin replying to the letters from her Ponies and Aquileians. She would go the Aquiliean Veteran’s Hall tomorrow and thank the republicans and their families that welcomed her and her father to their home. She would write back to everypony and griffin herself, even if it left her with a week-long horn cramp.

Next week, she would practice at the makeshift shooting range with Dusky Mark for the first time, then practice ice and fire spells with Far Sight at the junkyard. Her laser could cut through reinforced plating now. Thorax didn't approve of her training, but her guards were eager to aid their Princess.

Princess Flurry Heart turned on her pillow and stared at the little crown on her dresser until she fell asleep.
> Part Six
> --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flurry Heart brought the rifle up again and slammed the trigger with the side of her hoof. The rifle kicked into her shoulder as she worked the bolt with her magic, chambering in another round.

The glass bottle on the fence exploded.

She braced, took aim at the next bottle, and fired again. She moved down the fence, picking off stationary bottles. After three more shots, Flurry crouched and removed a new stripper clip from the pouch on her flank with a flash of magic.

“On the left!”

Flurry dropped the clip in her magic, catching it on an outstretched hoof. Her horn flashed as she pulled the revolver from the holster on her other flank and looked to the left. She brought the revolver to her eye and fired off six shots. While she fired, she rammed the clip into the bolt-action rifle and cycled it by hoof. She dropped the pistol in her magic and braced the rifle back against her shoulder, one forehoof on the open trigger and the other braced on the frame.

“Panzer on the right!”

Flurry turned and fired a blast from her horn. The tips of her short-cut mane blackened from the heat.

A glass bottle flew at her head from above.

Flurry barely brought up a shield in time. The bottle shattered a hoof from her muzzle as she stared wide-eyed.

“Hey!” Flurry glared at the griffon hovering above her. “You didn’t call out!”

“Sometimes there is no warning, Princess,” the brown griffon shouted back down.

“Do not throw bottles directly at the Princess, Duskcrest!” Dusty shouted. “How many bucking times do I have to tell you!?”

“I do it to hear your adorable swears,” Duskcrest answered to the mare standing several hooves behind Flurry.

“You’ll hear a lot worse later!”

“Oh,” Duskcrest laughed, landing to Flurry’s left and adjusting his old forest jacket. “Is that a promise?” he asked, smiling.

Flurry didn’t have to look behind her to know Dusty was blushing.

“Besides,” he continued, “you should have stopped the Princess after her little trick with the revolver.” He looked at Flurry and waved towards the bottles lined up on an old truck engine to her left.

Flurry dropped the shield around her muzzle and set the safety on the rifle before looking over. She scowled.

Four out of six bottles to her right were still standing on the old truck engine. They were easily within pistol range. She was in a scrapyard outside Evergreen, the largest city in the mountains. It had been converted into a shooting range for the town’s militia.

She picked up the revolver with her hooves and opened the cylinder, ejecting the spent cases. She brought the sights up to her eye again. “It’s not aligned right.”

“It’s my gun,” Dusty answered, walking up to Flurry’s right. She took the pistol from Flurry’s hooves with a flick of gray magic and loaded a single cartridge. She took aim down the range with the pistol in her magic. Dusty squinted, exhaled and fired.

One of the bottles shattered. Flurry was aiming at those with her rifle.

“The sights are fine, Princess,” Dusty said and holstered the pistol.

Flurry sat on her flank and crossed her hooves before lighting up her horn. The remaining bottles downrange glowed blue  and shattered in her grip. Duskcrest reached out with a claw and flicked her ear.

“Yes, your horn is your greatest weapon,” Duskcrest sighed, “but it is not your only one.”

He gestured at the bottles on the engine. “You are fast, but that is nothing without accuracy. You are trying to do too many things at once.” He pointed at the sandbags around Flurry. “Use your cover and take your time.”

Dusty walked over to the metal plate propped up by some large rocks on the right. She winced and shook her graying mane. “Well, you punched through the reinforced plate and definitely killed the crew, but if there’s one panzer, there’s at least a dozen more rumbling behind.”

Flurry sighed and brushed her stubby curls aside. She had cut her mane and tail almost indecently short, if not for her white cargo pants and jacket. She couldn’t wear a helmet; the heat from her lasers would melt it to her head.

“If I had a submachine gun or an automatic rifle, I wouldn’t have to take my time,” Flurry remarked.

“I wish I had one of those, too!” Duskcrest laughed. “Can you ask Blackpeak to loan us some instead of sending them to the coast guards?”

"We work with what we have, Princess," Dusty rebuked.

Duskcrest patted her head. “You’re a better shot at fourteen than I was, and I spent my youth as a bandit in our mountains."

“Great,” Flurry replied.

Colonel Duskcrest backed the attempted coup just before the Great War. Nova Griffonia long depended on local militias instead of a professional army. The general he followed, Erwin Highhill, rallied the underpaid militias in the mountains, promising them reform and appreciation. He flew down from the mountains and took the provisional government by complete surprise, but failed to take the capitol building in Weter and was arrested on its steps.

The struggling Republic couldn’t afford to arrest and disband all of the soldiers that followed Highhill as the war between Equestria and the Changeling Lands raged at their southern and western border. The provisional government instead returned them to the mountains to help the massive amount of pony refugees settle in their homes. They demoted the commanders and lent them no support to deal with the refugees.

Flurry guessed that the government wanted the exiled griffons to get distracted squabbling over their homes with the ponies; it worked for several years. Ponies formed competing militias to defend themselves against banditry and extortion.

Flurry Heart’s arrival changed that. Her tours and interest in the mountains gave her Ponies hope, and that hope began to spread to the griffons that lived uneasily beside her ponies before radiating out to the militias. Militias of ponies and griffons merged and began to work together as violence between the races died down. The economists in Weter saw the beginning of slow economic growth and sighed with relief, ignoring the issue.

Of course, none of the government money went to the griffons and ponies in the mountains. President Blackpeak and the Republicans were focused on the coast, reinforcing it against the Reich. They were content to let Flurry play with her ponies, placating them and ensuring that they paid their taxes as good citizens. Her ponies were still poor, but they were poor together with the griffons. Duskcrest attended Flurry's birthday party when she turned thirteen, presenting her with a silver-plated revolver.

"For my nephew, he would have died of Feather Flu."

Flurry Heart heard that an epidemic was sweeping through several mountain towns, affecting pegasi and griffons alike. Weter had stockpiled medicine for the major cities, but there were few doctors inland, even among the ponies. There was a simple spell to relieve the worst symptoms, but even the strongest unicorn couldn't cast it several times a day, everyday. Flurry made an emergency trip to the mountains, dragging along a unicorn doctor to learn the spell.

She did not sleep for three nights, teleporting and flying from town to village, outpacing her desperate guards. She dragged herself into the last village, bleeding from the nose. It was an all-griffon village halfway up the highest peak on the Nova Griffonian side of the border. Flurry looked bad enough that the griffons assumed she was dying of the flu herself and avoided her. She stumbled into the schoolhouse, then makeshift clinic, and lit up her horn. She didn't quite pass out, but Thorax's changelings had no problems subduing her and dragging her back to Weter when they finally caught up to her.

It took her a month of bedrest to recover, then another three months before she was allowed outside her room. But the death toll was in the single digits when it could have been in the thousands. She had prioritized her Ponies, but she came for the griffons when no griffon from Weter would. There were a lot of stereotypes about griffin greed, but they would pay back a debt.

Flurry waved a wing at the silver revolver when Duskcrest offered it. "Give it to your nephew and teach him to use it."

"As you command, Princess," he replied. The griffons that arrived with him to the party nodded.

Her griffons, she thought with a smile as she shrugged at Duskcrest. "I'm glad to hear I'm a better shot than a fourteen-year-old, filthy bandit." On paper in Weter, he commanded a force of five hundred. In practice, he led a combined militia of five thousand, and held the loyalty of a two dozen smaller militias all over the Crystal Mountains. 

He laughed. “Highhill was a fast shot, but he was too reckless. Speed didn’t save him from the noose.” He passed Flurry a canteen, pouring a bit of water into his beak in front of her. She took it in her magic.

Flurry trusted him, but she appreciated the gesture. Dusty walked around the yard and squinted at the setting sun. “One more hour, Princess, then back to Evergreen.” 

Flurry nodded. A few bat ponies and griffons patrolled overhead as she drank from the canteen.

Officially, she wasn’t here; she was in Weter. Every month, Flurry Heart would travel into the mountains for two days to practice while Falx imitated her voice from her room if anypony came by. Thorax knew, of course, and it drove him crazy that she would do this every month.

Thorax does more dangerous things every week, she snorted to herself.

Thorax did more than help the government root out Changeling spies for Chrysalis. He lived in Weter to work with the black market at the port, running smuggled gems from the mountains to unicorns for dubious enchantments. The gems went to the Reich and embargoed amenities came in. He confessed to her at thirteen that most of the ghetto in Weter was involved. The ghetto was nicknamed ‘Ponyville’ by Weter Radio, but no one dared say it to Flurry’s muzzle. Flurry’s guards were funded by crime. Technically, everything Flurry depended on was funded by crime.

Her magic tutor Far Sight made a living enchanting stolen gems. “I could work in Triton’s Armories casting spells on rifles for half as much,” he explained, “or I could do it for Thorax and feed my niece and nephew.” He was a mustard-yellow unicorn with a brown mane. Before the war, he was a professor from Trottingham. He still wore his tweed jacket, now significantly patched and scuffed.

“Who does Thorax work for, then?” Flurry asked, looking up from her notebook and old spell tome.

Far Sight paused for a moment too long while writing on the magical blackboard he summoned in her room. Flurry coughed, and he dispelled it and turned to her. He opened his mouth to lie, but Flurry’s glare made him reconsider.

“Thorax runs it, doesn’t he?” She asked, more as a statement than a question.

He nodded.

“Does he hurt Ponies?”

He hesitated again. “Usually not.” Flurry thought about Gunner, leaning against his truck with a bloody beak.

I questioned him thoroughly.

I thought he did it to protect me, she thought.

Her magic lesson ended early that day.

Flurry avoided the conversation with Thorax. He avoided talking to her about it as well, even though Far Sight certainly told him. Thorax lived poorly in a tenement beside ponies and changelings. He cherished what little free time he spent with her, reading a dog-eared book with poor binding or using the rare bit of chocolate to make cocoa. No matter how often Flurry hugged him and called him family, he still looked lean and tired. 

This isn't something he does for fun, Flurry decided. He does it for me, and it’s killing him.

Flurry Heart had lived in Nova Griffonia for four years, and her Ponies still suffered and lived like refugees and criminals. Any improvement to their lives came from her, not the government. Triton Blackpeak was two years into his second term and he had still accomplished little of his promises to them.

The remnants of the Griffonian Republic had organized into an opposing political party led by the son of their dead President. Alexander Kemerskai Junior was a decade older than Flurry. He met her only once, an accident when she arrived for a photo opportunity with Blackpeak at the Capitol Building in downtown Weter. He sneered at her in the hallway to the Rotunda, spying the golden band under her blue and pink mane.

“It is disgraceful that a proud Republic would allow you to strut about wearing that,” he scoffed with a heavy accent. Kemerskai wore a faded green camo jacket and pants with a green cap. He dressed like he was still in a command tent.

“This?” Flurry pretended not to understand, and gestured to her white dress with pink flowers and ruffles. It was stiff and made her wings cramp, but it looked nice in a photograph.

He squawked a laugh and pointed at the simple crown. “That,” he spat. “You are a shining example of the downfall of hereditary rule.”

So are you, she thought, but instead said, “Thank you for the compliment, Mister Kemerskai,” and dipped her wings in a bow. He stalked away with his entourage, laughing at her naivety. Flurry kept her muzzle still.

Kemerskai dreamed of grinding the Reich against Nova Griffonian shores, then returning triumphantly to Griffenheim and avenging his father. He harnessed the discontent of a few native griffins that were upset about losing jobs to cheaper pony labor, but he had two more years to campaign and make promises. The next election would occur after Flurry Heart turned sixteen and was legally an adult. If Kemerskai won, he would demand she become a citizen and renounce her crown, if not worse. 

Flurry had to be ready. She would not flee again. Her Ponies, nearly a million strong, would stand with her. The griffons in the hills and mountains would back their pony neighbors against the government. The Aquileians had been allies to Griffonian Republic, but Kemerskai publicly blamed the war’s loss on them. Flurry Heart made overtures to them every year on her birthday, and ‘Little Flurry’ had gradually sounded more like a title than a gesture of affection from the Aquileians. 

If it came to it, they might not fight for her, but they might not fight for Kemerskai, either.

Like everything, the true challenge came down to Chrysalis. If Nova Griffonia tore itself apart during a civil war, Changeling panzers had free reign to storm in and declare victory. If the Griffonian Reich invaded, the Changelings could sweep in from the south and west. The mountains and tundra would make progress slow, but Nova Griffonia could not fight a two-front war. Her Ponies would suffer first.

Flurry Heart set the canteen down and looked at the rifle. It was an old bolt-action rifle from the beginning of the Great War; the purple paint had worn away, leaving gray smears along brown wood. She had been using it for two years. Flurry felt the magic around the rifle, the imprint left behind by previous owners. Flurry found that weapons took auras based on who held them and used them. Dusty’s pistol had killed once; she carried it since the war. It felt like loyalty bordering on stubbornness and pride.

The rifle was different. The rifle had not been fired it battle; it had not killed. There was an old aura of fear and terror around it. 

Flurry Heart looked back at the pants covering her bare flank. Most colts and fillies had a cutie mark by fourteen. She still told no one about her sense, not Far Sight, Dusty or Thorax. It seemed to be entirely unique to her. She closed her eyes and focused on the rifle. 

A pony died holding it, alone and afraid. A filly, barely older than me, fresh out of training. She was at the front, terrified. She remembered Celestia’s voice on the radio and climbed out of the trench. A shot knocked her down. Another pony took the rifle as they ran. It traded hooves quickly-

“Princess?”

Flurry Heart snapped her head back up and glanced sheepishly at Duskcrest. Dusty also looked concerned.

“Sorry, I was thinking,” she said. “Where’s this rifle from, again?”

“You've asked that before,” Dusty commented.

“One of the old stockpiles from after the war,” Duskcrest answered easily. “Most of the militias use semi-automatics now, but these work fine in an ambush.” He wagged a wing at her. “When I’m impressed with your accuracy, we’ll upgrade.”

“You don’t want me to break your fancy guns?” Flurry asked.

Duskcrest gave an exaggerated, wide-eyed look at the smoking hole in the armor sheet across from him. “Of course not, Princess.”

Flurry laughed.

“Princess!” A green pegasus in flannel flew towards the junkyard from the direction of Evergreen. The guards flying around the scrapyard unslung their rifles and shotguns and faced him, shouting threats.

“Princess!” He waved his forelegs desperately, but didn’t stop.

Dusty drew and loaded her revolver as Duskcrest pulled out his own pistol.

Flurry Heart summoned a bubble shield around the Pegasus, trapping him midair. He slammed against the barrier, slumping down against the bottom of the bubble. His nose was gushing blood. He continued to wave down at Flurry Heart and shout, now muffled. She drifted the blue bubble closer.

“He could have a bomb,” Dusty warned.

“It’ll have to be a bomb bigger than him to break my shield,” Flurry replied distractedly. Flurry recognized the pegasus. He was Tree Trimmer, one of the managers of the logging company in Evergreen.

“Princess!” Tree Trimmer shouted through the shield, bowing awkwardly. A few of the patrolling griffons and ponies flapped their wings around the bubble, weapons ready.

“Princess, battle,” he gasped, voice nasally. Blood kept streaming down his muzzle. “There’s a battle!”

Flurry’s chest tightened. “Where?”

“We need to leave,” Dusty commanded. Duskcrest nodded.

He shook his head. “No, battle!” He gasped again. “Manehatten! On radio!”

Flurry blinked. She was so shocked that the bubble disappeared with a soft pop and Tree Trimmer fell twenty hooves to the ground. He didn’t flap his wings in time. He landed hard and his forelegs buckled, but he kept his eyes on Flurry.

“It’s started!” He was crying. “It started!”

Flurry seized Duskcrest and Dusty in her magic field and hugged them against her. She teleported to Evergreen with a crack.
